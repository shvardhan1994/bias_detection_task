Elizabeth Lauten, the communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.), wrote that the two teenagers should \"try showing a little class,\" \"dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar,\" and, most of all, \"don't make faces\" at Very Serious public events. Read the full rant via Gawker: Dear Sasha and Malia, I get you\u2019re both in those awful teen years, but you\u2019re a part of the First Family, try showing a little class. At least respect the part you play. Then again your mother and father don\u2019t respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter, so I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re coming up a little short in the \u2018good role model\u2019 department. Nevertheless, stretch yourself. Rise to the occasion. Act like being in the White House matters to you. Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. And certainly don\u2019t make faces during televised public events. The First Daughters join President Obama at the ceremony every year, where they can hardly contain their disdain for the lame dad jokes that predictably follow. Before approaching Mac and Cheese, the two turkeys, the president remarked that it was \"puzzling that I do this every year.\" Malia even declined her father's offer to pet one of the pardoned turkeys with a nonchalant, \"Nah.\" Lauten later apologized for rushing to judgment on Facebook. \"I reacted to an article and quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager,\" she said. \"After many hours of prayer, talking to my parents and re-reading my words online, I can see more clearly how hurtful my words were. Please know that these judgmental feelings truly have no place in my heart. Furthermore, I'd like to apologize to all of those who I have hurt and offended with my words, and pledge to learn and grow (and I assure you I have) from this experience.\"",

        "body": " President Donald Trump said he\u2019s considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who aren\u2019t citizens \u2015 a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment that could likely be changed only through a constitutional amendment. Trump said in an interview with \u201cAxios on HBO\u201d taped Monday that he could execute the change via executive order. \u201cIt was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don\u2019t,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress. But now they\u2019re saying I can do it just with an executive order.\u201d He said the right awarded to babies born as birthright Americans is \u201cridiculous\u201d and that the system \u201chas to end.\u201d Trump also falsely stated that the U.S. is \u201cthe only country in the world\u201d that offers citizenship to those born here. More than 30 nations, including Canada and Mexico, have similar policies. It\u2019s not clear what the executive order would look like or when it would be proposed \u2015 if Trump follows through at all, considering his tendency for pre-election bluster and warnings he has received from fellow Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.), who have said doing so would be outside the bounds the president\u2019s authority. All babies born in the U.S. are American citizens under the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment, which cannot be changed by presidential order. Changing that policy would dramatically reshape the U.S. \u2015 effectively punishing the children of undocumented immigrants, whom Trump has vowed to remove from the country. Even if he doesn\u2019t follow through or succeed, though, Trump\u2019s vow to try aligns with other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants ahead of the midterm elections next Tuesday. An executive order challenging birthright citizenship would ensure a legal battle, in which most experts think the president would fail. The Supreme Court ruled in 1898\u2019s U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark that a child born in the U.S. to immigrant parents was a citizen under the 14th Amendment. \u201cThe president cannot erase the Constitution with an executive order, and the 14th Amendment\u2019s citizenship guarantee is clear,\u201d said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project. \u201cThis is a transparent and blatantly unconstitutional attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred in the days ahead of the midterms.\u201d Some Republicans \u2015 including Ryan \u2015 quickly shot down Trump\u2019s idea. \u201cYou cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order,\u201d the House speaker said Tuesday on WVLK Radio, according to Bloomberg News reporter Erik Wasson. Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) criticized the president\u2019s statement, calling instead for immigration reform \u201cthat makes our country more secure and reaffirms our wonderful tradition as a nation of immigrants.\u201d Another Republican, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, also tweeted that such an executive order would not be possible. The are some experts who disagree. Axios cited John Eastman, a constitutional law professor at Chapman University and director of The Claremont Institute\u2019s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, who said the amendment has been misapplied and was not intended to apply to every person born in the U.S. regardless of parentage. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced Tuesday that he would introduce legislation \u201calong the same lines as the proposed executive order from President Trump\u201d to end birthright citizenship, a policy change he has supported for years. It\u2019s unclear what his legislation would look like \u2015 and he has previously suggested such a change would require a constitutional amendment. \u201cThis policy is a magnet for illegal immigration, out of the mainstream of the developed world, and needs to come to an end,\u201d Graham said in a statement on Tuesday. Trump has long supported ending birthright citizenship, recommending in 2015 on the campaign trail that the country \u201cstart a process\u201d to scrap it. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have American citizenship and if you speak to some very, very good lawyers \u2014 and I know some will disagree \u2014 but many of them agree with me and you\u2019re going to find they do not have American citizenship. Our country is going to hell,\u201d Trump said then in an interview with CNN. The president has lasered in on immigration ahead of next week\u2019s midterm elections, stoking fear about the caravan of migrants heading toward the U.S.-Mexico border from Central America. He has falsely claimed the caravan is stocked with criminals, gang members and Middle Eastern terrorists, and has threatened to cut off aid to Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, the countries where most of the migrants hail from. He deployed 5,200 active-duty troops to the border on Monday in what officials of his administration described as a necessary national security measure.",

        "body": " Setting the tone for the 112th Congress \u2014 in which every House bill must cite the constitutional source of its authority \u2014 members of the House of Representatives began to read the United States Constitution aloud from the chamber\u2019s floor on Thursday morning. Like the Constitutional Convention itself, things did not begin auspiciously. Before the reading began, Jay Inslee, Democrat of Washington, asked Republicans to illuminate exactly what part of the Constitution would be read, what parts would be deleted and who would decide how things would unfold. It was decided in advance that any portion of the Constitution that was superseded by amendments \u2014 including the amendments themselves \u2014 would not be read, preventing lawmakers from having to make references to slaves, referred to in Article 1, Section 2 as \u201cthree fifths of all other persons,\u201d or to things like prohibition. These inquiries about parliamentary procedure were not well received, and for several minutes, before a word of the preamble could be uttered, Democrats and Republicans battled back and forth over the issue of language, perhaps presaging future partisan battles over the meaning, purpose and application of the document. Once that was settled, just after 11 a.m., Representative John A. Boehner, the newly installed speaker of the House, read the preamble (that magical \u201cWe the people\u201d), before yielding to the woman who handed him the gavel on Wednesday, Representative Nancy Pelosi, who picked up with Article 1, Section 1 (\u201cAll legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives\u201d), followed by Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, and other House leaders. From there, members who wished to read were recognized from their seats, beginning with Representative Steve Rothman, Democrat of New Jersey. And so, sentence by sentence, in accents that reflect the myriad districts that did not even exist when the document came into being, by women and African Americans whose full rights were not recognized at that time, the constitutional language fluttered through the chamber. At one point, there was yelling in the chamber, and the sergeant-at-arms was called to remove a protester. The reading of the document on the floor of the House, an act that is part of the new rules package, serves several purposes, said Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, who came up with the idea for the live reading. Largely, it was meant to instruct members, who now must use it to underlie their bills, and to inform voters. \u201cThroughout the last year there has been a great debate about the expansion of the federal government, and lots of my constituents have said that Congress has gone beyond its powers granted in the Constitution,\u201d said Mr. Goodlatte, a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over constitutional amendments. He added: \u201cI think it is important that we send a message to people at home that the constitution is an important document.\u201d But it was also clearly meant as a nod to the Tea Party, a loosely organized political movement whose members cite the Constitution as the basis for much of their political theory concerning federal powers and the rights and responsibilities of Congress. To wit, the document reading happened on the same day that House Republicans began the contentious process of repealing the health care law, which they have long said lacks constitutional basis. The order of reading was ironed out at the last minute, with the goal of letting all who wished to read do so, but making sure there was party parity, Mr. Goodlatte said. \u201cWe have spread the word to everyone, and there was a lot of interest,\u201d he said. According to the Office of the Historian of the House of Representatives, the only two prior instances in which a full or partial text of the Constitution was inserted into the Congressional Record was in 1882, when Roswell Flower of New York \u201cappended\u201d a text of the Constitution \u2014 minus the amendments \u2014 into the record, and in 1915, when Thomas Reilly of Connecticut inserted the full text of the Constitution into the Congressional Record as an extension of his remarks. But the office could not find any examples of the full text of the Constitution actually being read out loud on the House Floor.",

        "body": " Like many conservative Republicans, Mitt Romney is opposed not only to same-sex marriage, but also to the civil unions that many states have adopted as an alternative to full marital rights for gay couples. Now that President Obama, long a supporter of civil unions, has publicly embraced same-sex marriage, the question of precisely what legal status and protections should be granted to gay couples is emerging as an issue of the starkest possible contrast between the two presidential candidates. In short, both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama have adopted the favored position of their ideological base on a subject that profoundly animates both of those camps. On Wednesday, in anticipation of Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement, Mr. Romney laid out his belief that marriage \u2014 and anything resembling it \u2014 should be restricted to heterosexual couples, even as he acknowledged that it was \u201ca very tender and sensitive topic.\u201d In doing so, he left open many questions about what his vision of legally recognizable gay unions would encompass, and what it would exclude. \u201cMy view is the same as it\u2019s been from the beginning,\u201d Mr. Romney told a CBS affiliate in Denver. \u201cI don\u2019t favor civil unions if it\u2019s identical to marriage, and I don\u2019t favor marriage between people of the same gender.\u201d Asked why he opposed civil unions, in particular, he explained that in many cases they represent marriage by a different name for gay couples. \u201cIf a civil union is identical to marriage other than with the name, why, I don\u2019t support that,\u201d he said Wednesday. Nine states, including California, Delaware and New Jersey, now allow civil unions and broad domestic partnerships that most likely fit Mr. Romney\u2019s description of marriage-like arrangements, meaning that they would be in the cross hairs of a President Romney, who supports a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. Those states offer an array of different rights to same-sex couples, among them the ability to pool resources for tax purposes, place a spouse on an employee health care plan and inherit property after a death. Mr. Romney has said that he favors allowing domestic partnerships that bestow certain rights on same-sex couples, like hospital visitation, but he has not delineated them in great detail. \u201cBenefits of that nature may well be appropriate, and states are able to make a provision for the determination of those kinds of rights,\u201d Mr. Romney said Wednesday. Republicans and Democrats, in their reactions to the president\u2019s support for same-sex marriage, said they saw a newly wide, and seemingly unbridgeable, gap between the two leaders on the issue. \u201cWe now have a clear choice between Romney and Obama,\u201d said Maggie Gallagher, a founder of the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage. She called the president\u2019s decision \u201ca huge mistake\u201d that would reward the Republican Party. Evan Wolfson, the founder of Freedom to Marry, a gay rights organization, said that now \u201cthere is absolutely no way that opponents of gay rights can hide behind any unclarity in the president\u2019s position and make the bogus claim that it\u2019s the same as theirs.\u201d Mr. Romney has, over the years, made it clear that his opposition to same-sex marriage and civil unions is a deeply held moral conviction, and he has not shied from using strong language to describe the offense he has taken to its introduction. When in 2003 the Massachusetts courts legalized same-sex marriage in the state, Mr. Romney, then governor, complained that the state had become \u201cSan Francisco East.\u201d And, speaking with a sense of alarm about gay couples, he warned a conservative audience that \u201csome are actually having children born to them.\u201d Democrats contend that, like Mr. Obama\u2019s views, Mr. Romney\u2019s feelings about gay rights have evolved, but in the opposite direction: During his campaign for the Senate in 1994, Mr. Romney vowed to seek \u201cfull equality\u201d for gays and lesbians, in a letter to the Log Cabin Republicans of Massachusetts. In that letter he argued that he was more supportive of gay rights than his Democratic opponent at the time, Senator Edward M. Kennedy. But at the time, same-sex marriage was a little-discussed item on the agenda of national gay rights leaders, and aides say Mr. Romney has consistently opposed both marriage and civil unions that resemble marriage for gay couples.",

        "body": " HOUSTON \u2014 The decision by Republican convention delegates to oppose abortion without explicit exceptions for rape and incest poses a tricky political challenge for Mitt Romney as he prepares to accept the presidential nomination in Tampa, Fla., next week. The vote puts the Republican Party at odds with Mr. Romney, who supports rape and incest exceptions, at a time that controversial comments by Representative Todd Akin, the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri, have increased national scrutiny on the divisive social issue. Mr. Akin said over the weekend that women\u2019s bodies will resist getting pregnant from a \u201clegitimate rape,\u201d comments that have been widely condemned, including by Mr. Romney who called for Mr. Akin to withdraw from the race. \u201cToday, his fellow Missourians urged him to step aside, and I think he should accept their counsel and exit the Senate race,\u201d Mr. Romney said in a statement, citing former Missouri senators like John Ashcroft, Kit Bond, John Danforth and Jim Talent. But Mr. Akin on Tuesday refused to step down from his race despite loud calls from his party\u2019s leaders to abandon his bid. Aides to Mr. Romney declined to say on Tuesday whether he would call on the convention delegates to reconsider their position on abortion. Calls and e-mails to a half-dozen advisers on the subject were not returned on Tuesday. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, tried to deflect questions on behalf of Mr. Romney, saying on Fox News that \u201cthis is the platform of the Republican Party, it is not the platform of Mitt Romney.\u201d The reluctance to talk about the platform reflects the delicate position that Mr. Romney is in when it comes to abortion policy. A supporter of abortion rights early in his political career, Mr. Romney later switched his position. This year, he captured the nomination of a party whose hard-core activists remained suspicious of Mr. Romney\u2019s late-in-life conversion to their cause. But as he prepares to accept that nomination next week in Tampa, Mr. Romney is once again being forced to carefully navigate between the uncompromising antiabortion positions of his party\u2019s base and the more moderate politics of the swing voters he needs to win over. The vote on the platform is an important part of the Republican Party\u2019s outreach to its conservative base. Mr. Romney and his aides have worked hard to ensure that social conservatives at the convention \u2014 and the voters they represent \u2014 do not feel left out. The party platform \u2014 and the positions taken on abortion, same-sex marriage and other social issues \u2014 are a key part of that effort. If Mr. Romney were to reject the party\u2019s tough abortion plank, it would send a politically difficult message to conservatives about how Mr. Romney might govern once he got into the White House. There could also be a flurry of conservative outrage at the convention, which could distract from the carefully choreographed event Mr. Romney\u2019s strategists are planning. But Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign is also trying hard to make sure that the convention projects an image that swing voters in battleground states will find appealing. Aides did not expect to be focusing heavily on the party\u2019s abortion positions this week. The campaign has already chosen in the last several weeks to move off its core message about jobs and the economy. The convention is intended to return the campaign\u2019s message to one of how Mr. Romney will get the nation\u2019s economy back on track. In the current political environment involving Mr. Akin\u2019s comments, a decision by Mr. Romney to accept the party\u2019s abortion plank will open his campaign to attacks from his rivals that he is out of step with moderate, independent voters. Democrats have already pounced. Officials with the Democratic National Committee quickly called the Republican abortion position the \u201cAkin plank\u201d and scheduled a news conference to denounce it. \u201cAmerican women know that Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan and the party they lead are the wrong choice for women and their families,\u201d a statement from the Democratic committee said. \u201cMitt Romney should do the right thing and denounce this dangerous language.\u201d",

        "body": " WASHINGTON -- The House Select Committee on Benghazi sent a formal interview request to Hillary Clinton\u2019s lawyer on Tuesday regarding emails she exchanged during her time as secretary of state. In a letter to the Clinton\u2019s lawyer, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the committee chairman, said the committee is not interested in emails relating to personal or private matters, and instead will focus solely on those pertaining to \u201cLibya and Benghazi during the relevant time periods.\u201d \u201cToward that end and because of the Secretary\u2019s unique arrangement with herself as it relates to public records during and after her tenure as Secretary of State, this Committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this Committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the Secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,\u201d Gowdy stated in the letter. Gowdy set a May 1 deadline for the interview. An interview, Gowdy argued, would provide protection for the likely 2016 presidential candidate\u2019s privacy and security for sensitive information. The request comes after reports revealed Clinton used a private email address and a server located in her New York home during her time as secretary of state. Last week, Gowdy said Clinton did not respond to any of the subpoenas requesting documents in the case, and her lawyer had informed the committee that the server used for emails during her tenure had been wiped clean. Gowdy said once Clinton is interviewed and all documents related to the 2012 Benghazi attack are shared, the committee will schedule a time for Clinton to testify publicly in a hearing. \u201cWe share the Secretary\u2019s desire these two conversations take place as quickly and efficiently as possible, and are willing to expedite both working with your office, the Secretary\u2019s schedule and our Democrat colleagues on the Committee,\u201d Gowdy said. \u201cWhat the Committee cannot do is conclude its work without assurances the Committee has all relevant information necessary for us to discharge the duties required of us.\u201d Gowdy went on to call Clinton\u2019s email situation \u201chighly unusual, if not unprecedented,\u201d and said it \u201cexacerbates\u201d lawmakers\u2019 needs to \u201cunderstand what the Secretary did.\u201d Earlier this month, Clinton said she had a private email account because she \u201cthought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.\u201d She admitted that \u201clooking back,\u201d it would have been better to carry the second phone.

        "body": " WASHINGTON -- The classified version of a State Department review of last year's assault on an American compound in Benghazi, Libya, found that it was impossible to say what exactly motivated the attackers, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton revealed Wednesday. Speaking at a pair of hearings on Capitol Hill to examine the Obama administration's handling of and response to the attacks, Clinton repeatedly cited the classified version of the review by a State Department Accountability Review Board, distributed to lawmakers last month. \"As the ARB makes clear, after their months of research the picture remains still somewhat complicated,\" Clinton said, during an exchange with Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho) at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"And I say that because in the unclassified ARB, it is -- I quote: 'Key questions surrounding the identity, actions and motivations of the perpetrators remain to be determined.'\" The question of what motivated the Benghazi attacks has often been viewed as a duality: Either it was the result of a mob angry over a recently released anti-Islamic video, or it was a terrorist attack. That the administration wavered over its public declarations of the cause of the assault -- repeatedly citing the video before eventually confirming that it was clearly an act of terrorism -- was widely interpreted among critics as evidence of a desire to suppress or conceal the truth. But from the start, the evidence on the scene in Benghazi was more complex. Reporters from The New York Times and Reuters who were on the ground immediately after the attacks relayed that people involved in the mob scene around the compound repeatedly cited the video as a cause of their anger. The Times later stood by that version of events, citing it in its fact-check of Republican attacks on Obama during the presidential campaign. The ARB, in its unclassified form, mentions that the attackers' motivation is the subject of an ongoing FBI investigation. But the classified version, Clinton said, detailed the possible motivations for the attack, and suggested while they were pre-coordinated and deliberate, they were also opportunistic and not planned extensively. In citing the classified report to rebuff congressional queries about the administration's handling of the crisis, Clinton was drawing on a powerful tool of her office, although discussing a classified document is sure to raise further questions. The added complexity wasn't always satisfying to the legislators who grilled her Wednesday. While being questioned at the House Foreign Relations Committee by Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), Clinton urged that he read the classified ARB report to find his answers. \"There are key questions surrounding the identity, actions and motivations of the perpetrators that remain to be determined,\" she said. \"I recommend that every member read the classified version, which goes into greater detail that I cannot speak to here today. To which Duncan replied: \"It was a terrorist attack. It's pretty clear what the motivation was.\"",

Asked later in the day whether it was fair to invoke God in the debate over the Congressional schedule, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said, \"Yeah, I think it's a fair jab if I do say so myself.\" \"I believe that phrase from the Bible is 'the Lord helps those who help themselves.' And I think the point the president is making is that, you know, we should -- we have it within our capacity to do the things to help the American people. And that's why he's working so hard to get Congress to take action on the American Jobs Act and the provisions therein,\" Carney told reporters at his daily briefing. The phrase quoted by Carney is not in the Bible, though it is often mistaken as a verse. Later when the official White House briefing transcript was released, there was an asterik, to Carney's statement, \"* This common phrase does not appear in the Bible,\" it read. Carney said the particular reference by the president to God was made in the context of \"inaction by the House of Representatives, which has spent time on issues like commemorative Hall-of-Fame baseball coins and reaffirming a motto that I don't think anyone doubted, is that \u2018In God We Trust' is our motto. So his point was simply that the House should get busy with matters of great importance to the United States and to the American people.\" During his remarks, the president also called out House Speaker John Boehner for what the administration has made a drumbeat over the last week -- a do-nothing Congress. \"What have you guys been debating, John? You've been debating a commemorative coin for baseball?\" Obama said. The House resolution on the national motto passed Tuesday was introduced by Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Va., and considered under an expedited floor procedure. It passed in a 396-9 vote. After the vote, Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., one of the nine lawmakers to vote against the resolution, said the nation faces bigger problems, such as the economy, failing public schools and poverty. \"Instead of facing these challenges and creating jobs to help American people make sure they have a roof over their head and food on their table, we are debating whether or not to affirm and proliferate a motto that was adopted in 1956 and is under no threat of attack,\" he said. House Republicans have argued that the procedural votes don't take up very much time. They add that they have brought up 15 bills that they contend will help create jobs but have been ignored in the Democratic-led Senate. The Senate is preparing to take up a portion of the president's jobs bill - on infrastructure -- after the $447 billion jobs package failed when offered as a whole. Carney contended that Congress wouldn't be focused at all on jobs if not for the president's power of persuasion. \"If not for the president's insistence on pushing the American Jobs Act, would we be having a debate about jobs and the economy right now in Washington or would Congress be -- or the Republicans in Congress be so divorced from the reality that Americans are encountering every day that they would be debating matters wholly unrelated to the primary concerns of the American people? I think that's possible. I mean, I know that Democrats would be out there pushing this, and certainly the president is,\" he said.",

Kathy Griffin has made a career out of shocking her public by telling stories of Lindsay Lohan\u2019s fire crotch and simulating oral sex with Anderson Cooper on CNN, but she took things to a whole new level with a controversial photo shoot. Shot by celebrity photographer and director Tyler Shields, the comedian stares the camera down in one photo, as she holds what resembles the bloody head of President Donald Trump. \u201cKathy is all about pushing the limits and she went above and beyond on this one. Now lets just hope she stays out of jail,\u201d a representative for Shields told HuffPost. In other (and considerably less gory) photos shot by Shields, Griffin poses by the pool in a revealing leather getup as a man holding a camera stands above her.

        "body": " Following President Obama's comments in a TV interview expressing his support for same-sex marriage, his likely GOP rival Mitt Romney said Wednedsay he maintains his opposition to it -- the same position he's had since he \"started running for office\" \"I have the same view on marriage that I had when I was governor and that I expressed many times. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman,\" he told reporters following an event at the Oklahoma Republican Party headquartersk, where he garnered the endorsement of Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin. Obama made the groundbreaking news in an interview with ABC. \"It is important for me personally to go ahead and affirm that same-sex couples should be able to get married,\" Obama stated. He previously had said he supported equal rights for same-sex couples but stopped short of endorsing gay marriage. When asked if he believed the president had flip-flopped on the issue, Romney said it's up to the public to be the judge. \u201cI believe that based upon the interview that he gave today on ABC it said that he had changed his view, but you\u2019re a better judge of that than I,\" Romney said. \"I just saw the reports that he had previously said he opposed same-sex marriage and now according to ABC News he saying that he supports it. If that\u2019s the case then you\u2019ll be able to make that determination on your own.\" Last year Romney had signed a pledge sponsored by the National Organization for Marriage promising to support a federal ammendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. On Wednedsay, though, he said that the rights of domestic partners should be decided by the states. \u201cStates are able to make decisions with regards to domestic partnership benefits such as hospital visitation rights, benefits and so forth of various kinds can be determined state by state,\" Romney said. Following Romney's news conference, Obama's campaign immediately pounced on the former governor's comments. Ben Labolt tweeted, \"@MittRomney just refused to say he supports hospital visitation rights at a federal level for gays and lesbians.\"",

Thursday night, the MedStar Washington Hospital Center issued a statement saying Scalise \"underwent a second surgery related to his internal injuries and a broken bone in his leg. He remains in critical condition, but has improved in the last 24 hours. The Congressman will require additional operations, and will be in the hospital for some time.\" Scalise, R-La., like other members of leadership, is assigned a full-time security detail from U.S. Capitol Police, who guard him in Washington and at home in his district. His detail was credited with putting down the attacker and saving lives. \u201cIf Scalise was not there, he\u2019s the one with security detail, we wouldn\u2019t have had any protection and God knows how bad that might have been,\u201d Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, told \"Fox & Friends.\" Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., acknowledged the incident has sparked new security questions for members without assigned police protection at events outside Capitol Hill. He, along with several other members of Congress, suggested the most critical change may be to boost security for large lawmaker gatherings, even informal ones like the baseball practice in Alexandria, Va. \u201cWe already had concerns and we have great law enforcement at home, first responders do a great job, but this makes you anticipate every event now in a new way,\u201d Brat said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s News HQ\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cForty guys get together at the same time, that would be a major security event normally, but I think we got a little excited and didn\u2019t think things through as well as we could have.\u201d Brat said lawmakers \u201cmay need to recalibrate public events,\u201d while also suggesting \u201ctighter security\u201d at town halls -- which most congressional lawmakers have scheduled through the summer recess. This year's town halls to date have been particularly rowdy and tense, prompting lawmaker concerns long before Wednesday's attack. The Wednesday attack injured Scalise; Matt Mika, a lobbyist for Tyson Foods; Zack Barth, a staffer from Texas Rep. Roger Williams\u2019 office; and two U.S. Capitol Police officers, Special Agents Crystal Griner and David Bailey. \u201cWithout Capitol Hill police, it would have been a massacre\u2014we had no defense\u2014we had no defense at all,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said on \"Fox & Friends.\" \u201cWe were like sitting ducks.\u201d Lawmakers have appealed for more security before, including after the 2011 shooting of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. A detail for every lawmaker is likely not possible -- and security already is provided for major events and lawmakers facing a specific threat. But there are broad questions at hand in boosting security beyond that: particularly, does it hurt democracy to put an added barrier between lawmakers and constituents? \u201cI bet most members of Congress would say they don\u2019t want [a] security detail\u2014I sure don\u2019t,\u201d Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Pa., manager of the Democratic congressional baseball team, told reporters. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich lauded the current system where lawmakers interact with the people on a regular basis in settings like grocery stores. He said the threat of the \"occasional deranged person\" should not change that. \u201cWe start surrounding these folks with layers of guards\u2014it will really cripple the ability to be a free society,\u201d he said on \u201cOutnumbered.\u201d Gingrich added: \u201cWe are a free country, and we\u2019re gonna run the risk of freedom.\u201d Rep. Williams backed Gingrich's comments in a press conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday. Rogers was injured during the attack when he dove into the dugout \u201clike a pool without water.\u201d But Williams suggested he would feel \u201csafer\u201d if he were allowed to carry a gun on Capitol Hill, reminding reporters that he\u2019s \u201ca big Second Amendment guy\u201d -- and said \u201cwe probably ought to take a look at our security in big groups like that.\u201d Doyle, too, suggested that could be the solution: \u201cI think when you\u2019re in an area with 30 or 40 members, where anyone can walk through, we need to re-think that\u2014but I think most members would tell you they feel fine and they\u2019re not looking for any security.\u201d Rep. Thomas Massie, R-K.Y., took calls for additional security a step further on Thursday by re-introducing legislation that would allow those who have concealed carry permits in their home states to carry in Washington D.C. U.S. Capitol Police have not announced any increased security measures for congressional lawmakers, but said they will \u201ccontinue to provide a robust and visible presence\u201d around the Capitol. James Norton, who was deputy assistant secretary at Department of Homeland Security under the George W. Bush administration, told Fox News that staffing each member of Congress with a personal security detail would cost billions and acknowledged the unwillingness of some members to have additional layers of security. But he said they need to consider \u201cthe dangers\u201d that come with public forums. \u201cYou have to consider that there is a lot of information for the public\u2014obviously members want to give as much information as they can\u2014a lot of calendars are broadcast, social media, information is readily available,\u201d Norton said. \u201cBut there are a lot of bad actors out there looking to do harm, and vigilance needs to be taken by each member and their staff.\u201d Brooke Singman is a Reporter for Fox News.

        "body": " WASHINGTON -- Real estate tycoon Donald Trump said Thursday he has doubts about whether President Obama was born in the United States and has sent investigators to Hawaii looking for answers. The \"Celebrity Apprentice\" star has shot up in the polls as a potential GOP nominee, in part because of his questions about whether Obama is constitutionally allowed to be president if he doesn't prove he is a natural-born citizen of the United States. \"I have people that actually have been studying it and they cannot believe what they're finding,\" Trump told NBC's \"Today\" show on Thursday. Officials in Hawaii have certified Obama's citizenship, but a segment of society -- labeled \"birthers\" in the vernacular -- have demanded additional proof. Trump said when he started seriously considering a presidential bid a few weeks back, he thought the president was native-born, but now he's not so sure. \"His grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya, and she was there and witnessed the birth. He doesn't have a birth certificate or he hasn't shown it. He has what's called a certificate of live birth. That is something that's easy to get,\" Trump said, arguing that Obama has spent $2 million in legal fees \"to get away from this issue.\" Calling it potentially one of the biggest scams in the history of politics, Trump said he'd like Obama to show his birth certificate. \"And to be honest with you, I hope he can,\" he told \"Today.\" Trump, who placed second in an NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll of potential 2012 Republican candidates, said he will decide by June whether to run, and if he is the GOP nominee, \"I'd like to beat him straight up,\" not on the basis of the question of where Obama was born. In the poll, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads the would-be group of contenders with 21 percent of Republican primary voters surveyed followed by Trump and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at 17 percent each. The Republican primary poll was taken as part of a March 31-April 4 survey of 1,000 adults, but the sample survey of Republican primary voters polled was only 238. In the poll, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich garnered 11 percent, while former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin earned 10 percent support. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty earned 6 percent, Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann got 5 percent, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum won 3 percent and Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour received 1 percent support. Asked in the interview how genuine his presidential ambition is, Trump, who would have to hand over the reins of his international empire in order to run the country, said, \"I always take things seriously, but I've never taken it seriously like this. I wish I didn't have to do it.\" But speaking on ABC News, New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who is insistent he personally is not a candidate for president in 2012, said he wasn't sure his friend Trump would be either. \"Donald's a really good friend of mine, I don't know that Donald really wants to be president,\" Christie said in an interview that aired Wednesday night. Christie: I don't know that he wants that in particular. ... We've spoken about it and all I could say to you is, I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\" Back on NBC, Trump said he wants Obama to do well, but the presidency is not going that direction. \"I love this country, but this country is going to hell. ... The world laughs at us. They won't be laughing if I'm elected president,\" he said. Trump accused Obama of conducting a confusing policy on the civil war in Libya, saying \"nobody knows what's happening, and now it looks like (Libyan strongman Muammar) al-Qaddafi is going to beat the United States.\" \"I'm only interested in Libya if we get the oil,\" Trump said. He said Obama \"doesn't have a doctrine (on foreign affairs.) Foreign affairs is, we take care of ourselves first.\"",

        "body": " Mo Cowan Senate: Deval Patrick Names Former Chief Of Staff To Replace John Kerry WASHINGTON -- Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick (D) on Wednesday appointed William \"Mo\" Cowan to the Senate seat vacated by newly confirmed Secretary of State John Kerry. Cowan will hold the seat in an interim capacity until an election in June. Patrick, Cowan and Lt. Governor Tim Murray were all smiles as they walked into a news conference to announce the appointment. \"He's cool,\" Murray said of Cowan. \"Tom Brady, George Clooney, James Bond, the president have nothing on Mo.\" \"It was a private fact, but now known publicly thanks to the lieutenant governor, that he also brought cool,\" Patrick said to laughs. He and Cowan shook hands and hugged. Cowan, 43, is a former chief of staff and former legal counsel to Patrick. Like Patrick, who grew up on the South Side of Chicago before attending Milton Academy, Harvard and Harvard Law, Cowan came from a poor background to Boston for education and made a career there. After growing up in poverty in rural North Carolina, Cowan went to Duke University and then Northeastern University School of Law. He never left, and became a prominent Boston lawyer. Cowan's appointment means that there will be two black senators serving together for the first time in American history. Neither was elected -- Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) was appointed in December after former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) left the chamber in the middle of his term. Cowan's selection is a step forward for a state that has a troubled history with race relations, exploding in the South Boston busing riots in the 1970s. Patrick, the state's first African-American governor, said recently on local cable television that it was a priority for him to pick a woman or a person of color for the seat. Cowan will become the second black senator from Massachusetts, after Edward Brooke, who served from 1967 to 1979. Patrick on Wednesday was asked to reflect on the fact that eight years ago, the highest black official in the state was Suffolk County D.A. Ralph Martin. Patrick said it was important to have black elected officials, adding, \"the commonwealth and the country [are] changing.\" Cowan said Patrick offered him the job on Tuesday, and he accepted. He said there would be \"no daylight\" between him and Kerry on policy. When asked about the looming sequester, he said the \"best-case scenario\" was a \"balanced approach\" of spending cuts and tax increases. \"I don't think anyone believes it's in the best interest to do straight across-the-board cuts,\" he said. Patrick has consistently said that the pick to succeed Kerry should not run in the general election slated for June 25. Cowan embraced the temporary appointment Wednesday, repeating over and over that his stint would be short. Asked about his political future, he said, \"I am not running for office; I am not a candidate in the future.\" The late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) requested in a letter written before his death that the interim pick to replace him not run in the general election, a principle that Patrick honored after Kennedy died by picking Kennedy's longtime chief of staff, Paul Kirk. Former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) was the only person to publicly campaign for the interim appointment, announcing his desire to fill the seat on MSNBC and doing subsequent interviews about it. Frank promised that he would not run in the June election if appointed, and he endorsed Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) for Senate, though the two fought over the redistricting process that Frank blamed for his exit from the House of Representatives. Progressive groups lined up to rally support for Frank, but Patrick reportedly bristled at his public pursuit of the seat. Frank praised Cowan in a brief statement Wednesday. \"I know Mr. Cowan is committed to working hard and in a socially fair and economically efficient manner toward solving pending budget issues,\" he said. \u201cI now look forward to working for the election of Ed Markey to continue this work, and to providing President Obama the support he deserves in carrying out the mandate he received in November.\" A Frank representative did not respond to interview requests from The Huffington Post. The only announced candidate for the general election is Markey, who has received a flood of endorsements from Democrats -- including Kerry -- and has a $3.1 million war chest. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) is expected to announce his bid Thursday for the seat. Lynch holds more conservative positions than Markey; he opposes abortion rights and voted against President Barack Obama's health care law. Former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) has not said what he will do, but the Associated Press reported Tuesday that he was \"leaning strongly\" towards a run and would likely announce his candidacy early next week. Brown has kept a low public profile since leaving the Senate in January, other than lashing out at his Twitter critics in a string of messages early Saturday morning.",

Progressivism, he told the Conservative Political Action Conference, is a cancer that must be cut out of the system. But he aimed his fire at Republicans as well as Democrats, and gave them little quarter, saying he did not know what the Republicans stood for. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to not suck as much as the other side,\u201d he said. Noting that he was a recovering alcoholic himself, he said that the party had to admit that it had a problem, which he had not heard it do. \u201cHello, my name is the Republican Party and I have a problem!\u201d he declared. \u201cI\u2019m addicted to spending and big government,\u201d he said, drawing cheers and applause from the thousands of people packed into the hotel ballroom.

He\u2019s got the money.\u201d While Fox said that he believes that Americans will not elect the real estate tycoon to the White House, he is concerned about the results of the Nevada caucus, in which, according to entrance polls, Trump won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote. \"I would like to know who those Hispanics are, because they are followers of a false prophet,\" Fox said. \"He\u2019s going to take them to the desert, and if they think that they will benefit with an administration led by Donald Trump, they\u2019re wrong. They must open their eyes. Please, you Hispanics in the U.S. \u2013 open your eyes.\" Fox added, \"It is not to defend our race, it is not to defend our creed, but to defend the same nation that is hosting you. This nation is going to fail if it falls into the hands of a crazy man.\" The former Mexican president, who led the country from 2000 to 2006, also questioned Trump\u2019s allegiance to the Republican party, or, for that matter, any political party. \"He\u2019s not a Republican. Absolutely not,\u201d Fox said. \u201cThose are not Republican principles. He is not a Democrat. He is just himself. He is egocentric.\" The comments from Fox echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, who a week ago asserted that Mexico will not pay for a border wall. \u201cMexican people, we are not going to pay a single cent for such a stupid wall! And it's going to be completely useless,\u201d Calder\u00f3n told CNBC. For months, Trump has stood by his initial comments about building a border wall and getting Mexico to pay for it. The morning after Calder\u00f3n made the comments, the GOP front-runner appeared on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \u201cI heard the head of Mexico said \u2018no way,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Now the wall just got taller,\u201d Trump said. Fox\u2019s interview on Fusion comes about 6 months after Ramos had his own very public skirmish with Trump in which the Spanish-language news icon confronted the billionaire during a press conference in Iowa \u2013 prompting the candidate's security team to remove Ramos from the room. Ramos later returned and Trump took several of his questions. \u201cHe tried to silence me,\u201d the Mexican-born journalist told Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly in August. \u201cAnd in this country, you cannot do that. I\u2019m a citizen. I\u2019m an immigrant. I\u2019m a reporter. And I have the right in this country to ask any question I want, to whomever I want.\u201d Ramos\u2019 interview with Fox also occurred as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden paid a visit to Mexico for an economic summit. Biden made a thinly-veiled attack on Trump on Thursday, decrying the reality TV star\u2019s \"dangerous\" rhetoric. \"Some of the rhetoric coming from some presidential candidates of the other team are, I think, dangerous, damaging and incredibly ill-advised,\" Biden said, according to AFP. \"I'm here to tell you: They do not, they do not, they do not represent the view of the vast majority of the American people.\u201d",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2015 FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was taken off special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team after Justice Department investigators discovered his texts disparaging President Donald Trump, has been fired from the bureau despite the recommendations of a career FBI official. Aitan Goelman, Strzok\u2019s attorney, said in a statement that Strzok was fired late Friday afternoon on the orders of FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich, despite an FBI career official\u2019s recommendation that Strzok face a 60-day suspension and a demotion. Goelman called the decision \u201ca departure from typical Bureau practice\u201d and said it contradicted FBI Director Chris Wray\u2019s earlier guarantee that the bureau would follow its regular process, despite Trump\u2019s disdain for the now-former FBI official. \u201cThis decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans. A lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of Congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzok\u2019s personal views ever affected his work,\u201d Goelman said. \u201cIn fact, in his decades of service, Special Agent Strzok has proved himself to be one of the country\u2019s top counterintelligence officers, leading to only one conclusion \u2015 the decision to terminate was taken in response to political pressure, and to punish Special Agent Strzok for political speech protected by the First Amendment, not on a fair and independent examination of the facts. It is a decision that produces only one winner \u2015 those who seek to harm our country and weaken our democracy.\u201d Strzok exchanged texts with former FBI official Lisa Page that disparaged Trump as well as other politicians, including various Democrats. He testified last month after the release of an inspector general report on the handling of the FBI\u2019s Hillary Clinton probe that described anti-Trump texts exchanged by bureau officials. Strzok, a 21-year veteran of the FBI, played a prominent role in both of the investigations surrounding the Clinton and Trump campaigns during the 2016 election. He was involved in the Clinton investigation, which was highly public, as well as the investigation into the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election, which the bureau never publicly acknowledged until months into Trump\u2019s presidency. Strzok subsequently joined the Mueller team, but left the team as soon as Mueller became aware of his anti-Trump texts. The precise justification for Bowdich\u2019s decision to fire Strzok despite the recommendation of the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility is unclear. But DOJ\u2019s inspector general was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by texts Strzok sent that \u201cpotentially indicated or created the appearance that the investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations,\u201d and particularly focused on one anti-Trump text that implied a willingness \u201cto take official action to impact the presidential candidate\u2019s electoral prospects.\u201d The inspector general report also criticized Strzok for his use of personal email to conduct FBI business. It\u2019s possible that the former FBI counterintelligence official\u2019s extramarital relationship with Page also played a role in the FBI\u2019s decision. Wray said at at a press conference in June that the bureau wouldn\u2019t \u201chesitate to hold people accountable for their actions\u201d after the disciplinary process. Trump celebrated Strzok\u2019s firing on Twitter, writing Monday that the investigation into his campaign \u201cshould be dropped\u201d and that the investigation into Clinton \u201cshould be properly redone.\u201d",

Boehner of Ohio said on Monday that Republicans had a one-in-three chance of losing control of the House in November, a surprisingly downbeat assessment from a Republican leader who until now has expressed no fears of losing the gavel. In an interview with Fox News, to be shown on Tuesday, Mr. Boehner delivered what aides called a wake-up call to his troops. \u201cI would say that there is a two-in-three chance that we win control of the House again, but there\u2019s a one-in-three chance that we could lose, and I\u2019m being myself, frank,\u201d he said in an interview first posted online by the newspaper The Hill. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a big challenge, and we\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d Mr. Boehner pointed to what aides called \u201corphan districts\u201d in Democratic-leaning states that would not be a factor in the presidential campaign. Local Republican Party affiliates are less organized in such states and turnout may be depressed. \u201cWe have 50 of our members in tough races, 89 freshmen running for their first re-elections, and we have 32 districts that are in states where there is no presidential campaign going to be run, no big Senate race,\u201d he said. \u201cYou take 18 of them, California, Illinois and New York, where you know we\u2019re not likely to do well at the top of the ticket, and those districts are frankly pretty vulnerable.\u201d House political analysts also have looked at such states, but redistricting in California \u2013 run by an independent commission \u2013 has been as tough on Democrats as it has been on Republicans. Illinois and New York could be a problem for Mr. Boehner\u2019s party, but Republican-run redistricting in North Carolina and Indiana would appear to counter those Democratic gains. But Democrats have become bolder on their predictions.

        "body": " Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine who capitalized on his straight-arrow image to win a seat in Congress, was expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges after a lengthy corruption investigation, people with knowledge of the case said on Friday. The charges against Mr. Grimm, 44, a Republican who was first elected in 2010 and represents Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, were expected to include mail fraud and wire fraud, and to focus largely on his conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned on the Upper East Side of Manhattan after he left the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2006, two of the people said. He was also expected to be charged with obstruction of justice, for allegedly lying under oath in a federal lawsuit. The investigation of the second-term congressman, by the F.B.I. and the United States attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn, began more than two years ago with an examination of Mr. Grimm\u2019s fund-raising for his 2010 race and expanded. Two of his fund-raisers have already been charged. One, Diana Durand of Houston, was charged with illegally funneling more than $10,000 into his campaign. The other, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty to visa fraud charges. But on Friday, it did not appear that the indictment would include any campaign finance charges or accusations that the congressman had misused his office, although several of the people noted that the investigation was continuing. They all spoke on the condition of anonymity as the charges had not been formally announced and they were not authorized to discuss the case. A lawyer for Mr. Grimm, William McGinley of Patton Boggs, confirmed in a statement that prosecutors intended to file criminal charges against his client and said that Mr. Grimm \u201casserts his innocence\u201d and that the investigation was \u201ca politically driven vendetta.\u201d \u201cAfter more than two years of investigation plagued by malicious leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy and strong-arm tactics, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office has disclosed its intent to file criminal charges against Congressman Grimm,\u201d Mr. McGinley said. \u201cWhen the dust settles, he will be vindicated. Until then, he will continue to serve his constituents with the same dedication and tenacity that has characterized his lifetime of public service as a member of Congress, Marine Corps combat veteran and decorated F.B.I. special agent.\u201d Spokesmen for the office of the United States attorney in Brooklyn, Loretta E. Lynch, and for the New York F.B.I. office declined to comment. Mr. Grimm, the only Republican member of New York City\u2019s congressional delegation, is up for re-election in November and faces a potentially formidable challenger in former City Councilman Domenic M. Recchia Jr., a Democrat who headed the Council\u2019s Finance Committee and was Christine C. Quinn\u2019s chief lieutenant when she was Council speaker. Healthalicious, the restaurant that the people said was a focus of the indictment, was on Second Avenue near 83rd Street. The company Mr. Grimm formed to operate it was called Granny Sayz, L.L.C., and was affiliated with a company connected to Mr. Biton, the fund-raiser. In January 2012, the New York State Workers\u2019 Compensation Board ordered Healthalicious to pay $88,000 for not carrying workers\u2019 compensation insurance. About a year earlier, two former deliverymen hired a lawyer who contacted Mr. Grimm\u2019s congressional office to complain that the restaurant had paid them less than minimum wage, did not pay for work beyond 40 hours per week and paid them in cash to evade scrutiny. Shortly afterward, Mr. Grimm filed papers with the state to dissolve Granny Sayz. The lawyer eventually sued Granny Sayz in federal court. Mr. Grimm over time developed something of a reputation for being hot-tempered, which did not set him apart from many others in Congress. But this year, during an encounter with a television reporter, he set a new standard for on-air congressional misbehavior and delivered a bizarre threat. After President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address, NY1\u2019s Washington reporter, Michael Scotto, interviewed the congressman about the speech. When he asked about the federal campaign financing investigation, Mr. Grimm stormed off camera but returned and threatened to throw Mr. Scotto off the balcony. Then, the congressman, speaking in a barely audible whisper as he stood close to the reporter, said Mr. Scotto was \u201cnot man enough\u201d and added: \u201cI\u2019ll break you in half. Like a boy.\u201d",

Paul LePage opened the door Tuesday to making an early exit from the governor\u2019s office following pressure from state lawmakers to step down. \u201cI\u2019m looking at all options,\u201d LePage said on talk radio station WVOM. \u201cI think some things I\u2019ve been asked to do are beyond my ability. I\u2019m not going to say that I\u2019m not going to finish it. I\u2019m not saying that I am going to finish it.\u201d Later in the day, LePage took to Twitter, though, to push back on media reports about a possible resignation. During the radio interview, the governor apologized repeatedly for an expletive-ridden voicemail he recently left for Democratic state Rep. Drew Gattine -- the latest controversy to hang over his office. Earlier, the Republican governor had refused to apologize for the message, even saying at press conference he wished it was 1825 so he could shoot Gattine in a duel. In a recording of the message obtained by the Press Herald, the governor identified himself and went on to curse out Gattine. \u201cI would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you c---sucker. I want to talk to you I want you to prove that I\u2019m a racist. I\u2019ve spent my life helping black people and you little son-of-a-b----, socialist c---sucker. You \u2026 I need you to, just friggin. I want you to record this and make it public because I am after you. Thank you,\u201d he said in the message. LePage initially said his outburst was justified because Gattine called him a racist \u2013 something Gattine has denied. The alleged name-calling came after LePage said during a town hall that he\u2019s collected a binder full of drug dealers arrested in the state showing that 90 percent of them \u201care black and Hispanic people from Waterbury, Conn.; the Bronx; and Brooklyn.\u201d The leaked voicemail prompted members of LePage\u2019s own party to question his ability to lead the state. During his news conference Friday, LePage offered more racially charged comments that have drawn fire, saying, \"A bad guy is a bad guy. I don't care what color it is. When you go to war ... you try to identify the enemy. The enemy right now, the overwhelming majority of people coming in, are people of color or people of Hispanic origin.\" But this isn\u2019t the first time LePage\u2019s comments have gotten him in trouble. The Republican governor has a long history of making controversial statements dating back to 2010 when he said if he were elected governor, he\u2019d tell President Obama to \u201cgo to hell.\u201d A year later, LePage said that NAACP officials, who had called him out for not attending a Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s event, could \u201ckiss my butt.\u201d In 2015, LePage was forced to apologize to the son of a cartoonist for The Bangor Daily News because he told him he\u2019d \u201clike to shoot\u201d his father. That same year, a charter school said LePage threatened to strip it of its funding if it did not rescind a job offer to Democratic state House Speaker Mark Eves. In January, he said drug dealers with names like \u201cD-Money, Smoothie (and) Shifty\u201d are getting Maine\u2019s white women pregnant. He later said he had misspoke and meant to say all \u201cMaine women\u201d not only \u201cMaine\u2019s white women.\u201d LePage\u2019s second and final term as governor officially ends in 2019.",

        "body": " Texas Congressman Who Settled Harassment Case With Taxpayer Funds Resigns Representative Blake Farenthold, Republican of Texas, in December at the Capitol.CreditJoshua Roberts/Reuters WASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Blake Farenthold, the Texas Republican who used $84,000 in taxpayer funds to settle a sexual harassment case with his former communications director, abruptly resigned from Congress on Friday afternoon. In December, Mr. Farenthold, who represented the 27th District of Texas, said that he would not run for re-election amid scrutiny over the payment and accusations from other aides that he set the tone for a hostile work environment in his office. At the time, he was one of several lawmakers to announce his eventual departure from Congress after being accused of sexual harassment and discrimination. \u201cWhile I planned on serving out the remainder of my term in Congress, I know in my heart it\u2019s time for me to move along and look for new ways to serve,\u201d Mr. Farenthold said in a statement on Friday, thanking his staff, his family and the voters who elected him. It was known for several years that Mr. Farenthold, already notorious for a heavily circulated photograph of him in duck pajamas, had been accused of sexual harassment by Lauren Greene, his former communications director. She sued him in 2014, claiming that he had illegally fired her after she complained about mistreatment. But in December, the extent of Mr. Farenthold\u2019s settlement was revealed when Congress\u2019s Office of Compliance released details of six settlements that it had paid out since 2013 as part of a review of discrimination and sexual harassment in congressional offices. His case was the only settlement involving sexual harassment since 2013. \u201cWhile I 100 percent support more transparency with respect to claims against members of Congress, I can neither confirm nor deny that settlement involved my office,\u201d Mr. Farenthold said at the time. A decision in 2015 by the Office of Congressional Ethics, an independent, nonpartisan board, cleared him of wrongdoing, and he promised to repay the settlement. A spokeswoman for Mr. Farenthold did not respond to questions about whether he had fulfilled that promise or whether he would do so after resigning. But fellow Republicans suggested that he had not. \u201cMr. Farenthold made a commitment that he would reimburse taxpayers for the settlement,\u201d said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Speaker Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. \u201cHe reiterated his commitment to the speaker, and the speaker expects him to follow through.\u201d Representative Steve Stivers, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, also said in a statement that he hoped Mr. Farenthold would be \u201ctrue to his word\u201d and pay back the taxpayer money. After the disclosure, more of his aides came forward to accuse Mr. Farenthold of fostering a hostile environment, describing a congressman with a harsh temper who made sexually explicit jokes and engaged in casual sexual banter. The House Ethics Committee also opened a subcommittee investigation into Ms. Greene\u2019s allegations. In a video in December announcing his resignation, Mr. Farenthold continued to deny the allegations, but he acknowledged running an \u201cunprofessional\u201d workplace and said he was \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d for his actions. At the time, Republican leadership praised his decision to step aside, over Democratic criticism that he should immediately resign. After his resignation on Friday, Mr. Farenthold deleted his Twitter account and the Facebook campaign page where he first announced his decision to not seek re-election. \u201cLeaving my service in the House,\u201d he said in his statement, \u201cI\u2019m able to look back at the entirety of my career in public office and say that it was well worthwhile.\u201d",

        "body": " NRA urges states to allow more armed officers in schools The National Rifle Association called Tuesday for state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds once they've gone through extensive training, as part of a set of recommendations that capped a weeks-long review in the wake of the Newtown mass shooting. The NRA initially took criticism from Democrats for focusing so closely on school security, and rejecting gun control measures, following the Connecticut shooting in which 26 people were killed. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre in December called for armed officers to be installed in every school in the country. Former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, who led the NRA's review, appeared to ease off slightly on the call for armed officers in every school -- he said it's \"important\" for every school to have at least one, but acknowledged these decisions are \"locally made\" based on unique budget circumstances. Hutchinson, though, did call for the creation of a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers. To accompany that, his group proposed a \"model\" state law that would allow certain personnel who have undergone this training to carry weapons on school grounds. \"This is not talking about all teachers,\" he said. \"Teachers should teach.\" The 225-page report also called for states to require schools to conduct a safety assessment and for a pilot program to be created assessing mental health as a pre-indicator for violence. Mark Mattioli, the father of one Newtown shooting victim, also spoke after Hutchinson's announcement to applaud the review effort. The review comes as Congress and a number of state legislatures pursue gun control legislation. While a few have focused on school security -- South Dakota has already approved legislation allowing for teachers to be armed -- many have concentrated on enacting or expanding assault weapons bans, strengthening background checks and passing other measures to restrict access to firearms. Connecticut, the home of the Sandy Hook school shooting, is the latest to advance a sweeping gun control proposal -- lawmakers announced a deal Monday on a package that is likely to win approval. But LaPierre in December argued that improving school security is paramount. He argued that if banks and members of Congress can have protection, schools across America should be afforded the same security. \"It's now time for us to assume responsibly for our schools,\" he said. \"The only way to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be permanently involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection.\" He added: \"The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\"",

Arpaio is a hardliner on immigration, leading a push in Maricopa County for more enforcement. He is famous for pushing worksite raids and creating a \"Tent City,\" a military-style holding ground for inmates, now in its eighteenth year. His endorsement of Perry comes after the candidate was criticized for his immigration platform, which rests on the idea that deportation of all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country is impractical and unlikely. Perry also opposes a full border fence, although he calls for more enforcement along the southwest border with Mexico. \"The federal government has failed on border crime and border enforcement, and no candidate for president has done more to secure the border than Governor Rick Perry,\" Arpaio said in a statement. \"I have been watching Governor Perry and Texas closely and know his border surge operations with state, local and federal law enforcement officials have helped shut down the illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs and people. I'm endorsing Rick Perry because we need a tough-on-crime president who will champion and fund full-time border security operations from Brownsville to San Diego. Governor Perry has a superior border security record and plan to make our border and our nation safer.\" Perry said in a statement that if elected president, he would \"secure the border within a year.\" As Texas governor, he directed funds to enforcement along the border and requested more National Guard troops from President Barack Obama. \"Sheriff Arpaio knows the struggle border states face as Washington politicians and bureaucrats fail time and again to properly secure our nation's southern boundary with Mexico,\" Perry said in a statement. \"I am honored to have Sheriff Arpaio's support for my presidential campaign and our shared goals of fighting border crime with more personnel, border fencing and surveillance. A secure border is vital to protecting America's national security, public safety and jobs. As president, I will secure the border within a year putting thousands more federal boots on the ground, strategic fencing and aerial resources to fight border crime and make our states and nation safer.\" Arpaio endorsed Mitt Romney in 2008, choosing him over eventual nominee and fellow Arizonan John McCain. He held a joint press conference with Herman Cain in October after the two met to discuss immigration enforcement.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Ra\u00fal R. Labrador, a Republican of Idaho who has barely served two terms in Congress, jumped into the race for House majority leader on Friday, offering himself as the more conservative alternative who could pull the House rightward in the wake of Representative Eric Cantor\u2019s loss in a primary. \u201cThe message from Tuesday is clear \u2014 Americans are looking for a change in the status quo,\u201d Mr. Labrador, a former immigration lawyer elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010, said in a statement. \u201cPresident Obama and the Democrats have had their chance and they have failed. Republicans must be willing to take these challenges head on with new leadership, fresh ideas and a different approach.\u201d While some of those conservative lawmakers elected in 2010 were hoping that the House leadership elections on Thursday would offer them the chance to reclaim their influence on Capitol Hill, few of them give Mr. Labrador much of a chance against the current House majority whip, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California. Though Tea Party activists provided the energy and votes for Mr. Cantor\u2019s ouster, the elections might be more of a plea for a place at the leadership table. Supporters of Mr. McCarthy, who confidently traveled home to his district in Bakersfield for the weekend, said Friday that the Californian had all but sewed up the votes he needs. \u201cWe have got to have an alternative,\u201d Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, said on Glenn Beck\u2019s conservative radio show. \u201cI mean, for us as a party in Congress to send the message that we didn\u2019t learn a blessed thing from this amazing election result, we aren\u2019t paying attention.\u201d House conservatives \u2014 lacking a rationale to fight Mr. McCarthy, a well-liked member of leadership who has raised millions of dollars for Republican incumbents \u2014 have begun protesting that his voting record is actually to the left of Mr. Cantor\u2019s. FreedomWorks, which has provided financial support for Tea Party candidates, immediately began trying to generate support for Mr. Labrador through its websites and email lists. \u201cNow that grass-roots conservatives FIRED Eric Cantor, we need a new majority leader in the House of Representatives,\u201d FreedomWorks\u2019 website said Friday. Matt Kibbe, the group\u2019s president and chief executive, said that he did not have great qualms with Mr. McCarthy\u2019s ideology, but that he was more about politics than ideas. \u201cThe Republican penchant for just choosing the next guy in line hasn\u2019t proven to be a great strategy, and it hasn\u2019t picked good leadership,\u201d Mr. Kibbe said. But Mr. Labrador\u2019s path to victory is steep, especially in the few days before House Republicans gather to elect Mr. Cantor\u2019s replacement. Mr. McCarthy has been preparing for months to move up from No. 3 in the Republican leadership to No. 2 in the event that Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio would retire after the November elections. Conservative Republicans in the House pleaded Friday for a delay in the voting. Some grumbled that the campaign by the college professor David Brat to unseat Mr. Cantor had ousted the one member of House Republican leadership willing to listen to the House\u2019s most conservative members. Instead, the House will end up elevating a leader with a less conservative record and less patience for the far-right flank. For his part, Mr. Boehner has remained firm that he wanted to get it done quickly and minimize disruption. Mr. McCarthy spent much of the day calling members and shoring up support, said a Republican aide close to the majority whip. McCarthy supporters predicted that Mr. Labrador would muster no more than a few dozen votes. Some lawmakers questioned whether his run was really a quest to win the majority leader\u2019s post or merely to raise his own profile. His decision to jump in was widely seen as proof that more experienced conservative members, like Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio or Tom Price of Georgia, had rebuffed overtures to run from other conservatives. Tea Party groups off Capitol Hill may believe Mr. Labrador can win, and they will pressure House conservatives to join the campaign. But ultimately, supporting him could hurt more conservative members with the House leadership. Mr. Labrador tried on Friday to at least engage the Republican conference in a debate over ideas. He said the party needed to address issues like upward income mobility among the poor and middle-class economic insecurity. Born the son of a single mother in Puerto Rico, he has seen himself as an ambassador to young and minority voters out of reach to traditional Republicans. \u201cI am running for majority leader because I want to help create a vision of growth and opportunity for everyone and start getting to work for the American people,\u201d he said. Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, rushed to champion Mr. Labrador\u2019s candidacy. Mr. Amash, after all, voted last year to make him speaker of the House. \u201cWe can\u2019t respond to a stunning loss by giving a pat on the back and promotion to the same team,\u201d Mr. Amash said of Mr. Cantor\u2019s defeat. \u201cIt\u2019s time for someone new, someone conservative, someone who will put forward a fresh agenda, and someone we know is a proven and talented spokesman. That man is Ra\u00fal Labrador.\u201d",

        "body": " Senior White House officials significantly raised the stakes on congressional Democrats in their efforts to get a deal passed on the Bush tax cuts, warning on Wednesday that inaction would \"significantly increase the risk\" of a double dip recession. It wasn't quite the metaphorical flare of mushroom cloud imagery, but outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers offered a fairly dire assessment of the stakes in the tax cut debate. \"If they [Democrats] don't pass this bill in the next couple weeks it will materially increase the risk that the economy would stall out and we would have a double dip,\" he told a gathering of reporters at an off camera briefing. A double dip recession? \"What I said it would significantly increase the risk,\" Summers replied. The message was hardly subtle. But it certainly was debatable. Summers himself, downplayed the significance of continuing the Bush tax cuts back in September -- though he was speaking, then, about the rates for the rich and the tax cut deal, at that point in time, did not include money for a 13-month extension of unemployment insurance or other tax incentives to help lower income workers. Asked whether the country would find itself dipping towards the economic doldrums if Congress waited a month or two to get a tax cut package passed, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official in the Clinton White House and a proponent of the current tax cut deal, offered more sober-minded analysis. \"The wait would not cause a double dip,\" he said. \"A double dip would come out of the reality of a relatively contractionary fiscal policy... I do think the deal that they announced is stimulative. And it ought to boost growth by some increment... But the issue is, that the deal certainly is not enough to lift the economy to a different place. Will we see what happened with the large stimulus happen here, which is once the stimulus is over the economy returns to slow growth? That's the danger. And I keep on saying this, the single most important thing they can do to avert that is to stabilize housing prices.\" Stabilizing the housing market, however, is not on the current congressional docket. And on Wednesday, the White House began a robust process of selling the deal to Democrats -- skeptical, as they are, about an extension of Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and a generous revision of the estate tax. There were few carrots to go along with the sticks. Asked, for instance, if the White House would be willing to revise the informal compromise to bring more Democratic lawmakers on board, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said any changes would be fine, so long as they didn't result in decreased support. Then he cautioned: \"The physics and the blood and the sweat that might be involved in that, I'm not entirely sure I would put it quite as simply as that.\" If anything, the pitch being offered from the administration to the rest of the party was: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn. \"I guess the question back for those who ask [why not fight for more] is where does this go, what is the end game and what are the consequences of playing it?\" said senior adviser David Axelrod. \"Do they have a sense of how this ends and how long will that take, because as Larry said there are real consequences to that. Just as the forecasts went up on the basis of this agreement they will go down if this agreement fails. That we know. We know that on January 1 people's taxes will go up, we know that at the end of this month 2 million people will lose their unemployment insurance. And so there are real consequences to that decision. We, I think we all stipulate, the president did, no one likes those provisions that they dislike but on the other side of the ledger are significant things that will help people and help the economy. And what we know for sure is that without any of it we are facing a really difficult situation.\" Added Gibbs: \"I think you would really have to ask somebody who says... lets have some eight week fight and on February the 15th come in and say, alright, now we are ready to make a compromise, who on earth, who on earth thinks that that is somehow going to be a fundamentally better agreement than the one we are looking at right now?

        "body": " A male suspect was arrested in Florida on Friday morning in connection with the rash of suspicious packages sent to prominent Democrats nationwide, law enforcement sources confirmed to Fox News. Multiple sources identified the suspect to Fox News as Cesar Sayoc of Aventura, Florida. A separate law enforcement source told Fox News that the suspect is a white male in his 50s, who used to live in New York and had prior arrests for terroristic threats.  Several of the packages went through a U.S. postal facility in Opa-locka, which is less than 10 miles from Aventura. The Department of Justice will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. Federal authorities had been focusing on Florida as the location where the majority of packages originated. \u201cSome of the packages went through the mail,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen earlier told Fox News.  \u201cThey originated, some of them, from Florida.  I am confident that this person or people will be brought to justice.\u201d The Miami-Dade County Police Department confirmed Thursday it was helping federal agents who were at the facility in Opa-locka as part of the ongoing investigation. The USPS operates an innovative imaging system that photographs each piece of mail processed throughout the country.  Investigators were likely relying on that system to pinpoint where some of the packages were mailed. The FBI said the packages each consisted of a manila envelope with a bubble-wrap interior containing potentially destructive devices.  The packages were addressed with a computer-printed address label and six stamps. A government source told Fox News the FBI was analyzing the stamps in Quantico.  The source also said the investigation had progressed \u201csignificantly\u201d and that the FBI was reaching out to retailers to zero in on where the elements of the bombs were made and where they were sold. The envelopes and packaging materials likely contained a treasure trove of DNA information.  Tiny bits of genetic material \u2013 traces of sweat, skin cells, saliva, hair or fingerprints \u2013 are typically used as a roadmap to the suspect\u2019s door, investigators and bomb experts say. The Washington, D.C., field office and the FBI headquarters had 24 teams in place and on the hunt for the culprit. Forensic investigators in Quantico, Va., have been sifting through the packages addressed to former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, liberal billionaire George Soros, former Attorney General Eric Holder, former CIA Director John Brennan and California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters. The devices are thought to have been fashioned from crude, bomb-making designs widely available on the Internet.  Authorities haven\u2019t said whether the devices were built to explode and kill or simply sow fear. Ryan Morris, founder of Tripwire Operation Group, a company that provides explosives training to law enforcement and military officials, called the devices \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d bombs that were meant to be found.  He told Fox News he believes the primary motive is fear.  The packages were sent about two weeks ahead of the midterm elections. Regardless, investigators were treating the devices as \u201clive\u201d explosives New York City Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill said. Larry Johnson, a former head of criminal investigations for the U.S. Secret Service who also served as a special agent in charge of the presidential protective detail, agreed that bomb makers usually leave evidence \u2013 and their signature- behind. \u201cIf there is a human involved, there is a high probability you\u2019re going to get somewhere investigatively,\u201d he told The Associated Press.  \u201cThere will be no stone left unturned.\u201d Johnson believes it\u2019s \u201chighly likely\u201d the person who built the bombs will have been previously flagged by law enforcement.  The Secret Service maintains a wide database of groups and individuals who have made threats in the past against presidents or other top political leaders and activists via email, letters or on social media. James Fitzgerald, a retired FBI profiler and forensic linguist who, in 1996, helped catch \"Unabomber\" Ted Kaczynski -- who killed 3 people and injured 23 in bombings between 1978 and 1995 -- told Fox News on Wednesday that the letter sent to John Brennan, the former director of the CIA and a staunch Trump critic, reminded him of something the Unabomber would send because of the number of stamps used on the package. \u201cThe linguist in me noticed that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the last name is spelled missing a \u2018c\u2019 and John Brennan\u2019s name is spelled missing an \u2018n\u2019 and that kind of surprised me and I have a feeling that was done on purpose to make this look like somebody who doesn\u2019t really know who these people are and that it wasn\u2019t an honest mistake.  If he had this much anger and vitriol against these people, you would think he would know how to spell their names",

The former secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate released the tax returns on her campaign website, along with her health records and a list of paid speeches she and her husband gave. According to the returns, the Clintons earned $140,937,785 over the eight year span, primarily from book sales and speaking fees. The couple paid $43,885,310 in federal taxes and $13,625,777 in state and local taxes, and made $14,959,450 in charitable contributions during that time. Last year, the Clintons paid an effective federal tax rate of 35.7 percent and donated over 10 percent of their income to charity. \"We\u2019ve come a long way from my days going door to door for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund and earning $16,450 as a young law professor in Arkansas\u2014and we owe it to the opportunities America provides,\" Clinton said in a statement accompanying the returns. \"I want more Americans to have the chance to work hard and get ahead, just like we did. And reforming the tax code can help.\" The Clintons have previously released their tax returns dating back to 1977. Clinton's release comes about one month after Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush released 33 years of returns, showing his net worth between $19 and $22 million. Bush paid an effective tax rate of roughly 36 percent over those three decades. In May, Hillary Clinton filed a disclosure with the Federal Elections Commission showing the couple had earned approximately $30 million from book sales and speeches in 2014 and the first four months of 2015.",

Chris Dodd, D-CT, finds himself on the political ropes after a newspaper exposed a past incorrect statement regarding his service in Vietnam, and Republicans smell an opening. Sen. John Cornyn, R-TX, who heads the GOP campaign committee, said Tuesday, \"I think it's a blockbuster revelation,\" and predicted, \"I think it's definitely going to make that race more competitive.\" Blumenthal's campaign disputed a report in the New York Times as an \"outrageous distortion\" of his service in the Marines - six months on Paris Island and six years in the reserves, according to his campaign. The A.G., according to the Times, said he had misspoken at a 2008 event in Norfolk in which he said he had served in Vietnam. At that March 2 event, which can be found here on You Tube, Blumenthal, advocating for troops returning from war, clearly says, \"We have learned something very important since the days that I served in Vietnam... whatever we think about the war, whatever we call it 'Afghanistan or Iraq, we owe our military men and women unconditional support.\" Cornyn's Democratic campaign counterpart, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-NJ, Tuesday offered a critical vote of confidence in the attorney general, saying his lifetime of support for veterans is what really matters. \"I think he's corrected the record in the past. I think his actions standing up for veterans for a long time speaks volumes,\" Menendez said, \"I'm sure he will continue to stay in the race...and we'll continue to support him.\" Dodd, who faced an onslaught of criticism for his involvement with now-defunct Countrywide mortgage broker, among other problems, quickly scuttled his re-election plans in order to make way for the exceedingly popular Blumenthal, when it was clear in polls that Dodd was not likely to win his race. Blumenthal will face the winner of the GOP primary on August 10 - either former Cong. Rob Simmons, himself a Vietnam vet, or former WWE wrestling executive Linda McMahon.

        "body": " Mike Huckabee, the Baptist minister who became Arkansas governor, announced Tuesday he'll run for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Huckabee made the announcement in his hometown of Hope, Arkansas. \"I am a candidate for president of the United States of America,\" he said. During his announcement, Huckabee said that he would \"conquer Jihadism\" and protect Social Security. He also criticized the Supreme Court for potentially overturning bans on same-sex marriage. He also said that he favored term limits for individuals in all branches of the federal government -- including the judiciary. \"The Supreme Court is not the supreme being,\" he said. Huckabee, 59, quit his job hosting his own Fox News show, \"Huckabee,\" in January. Last month, he began plotting campaign strategy and hiring staff. Huckabee ran for president in 2008. He joins an already crowded 2016 Republican field, and will likely enlist support from the party's far right wing, where he faces competition from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has positioned himself as a tea party favorite. Huckabee said on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" last month that he's confident he can broaden his appeal beyond evangelical Christians and social conservatives to reach working-class Republicans concerned about the economy. \"There's a real sense in the Republican Party that there's no one speaking, not only to them, but speaking for them,\" Huckabee said then. \"And if someone can capture both the blue-collar, working-class Republicans, the conservatives, many of them even union members, as well as evangelicals, there's a real pathway to the nomination.\" Huckabee, an ordained Southern Baptist minister, is a celebrated figure among evangelical Christians. He was the longest-serving Arkansas governor, from 1996 to 2007. He made national headlines for losing more than 110 pounds from 2003 to 2006, and he publicly addressed his struggles with weight. His book, \"Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork,\" became a bestseller and he made obesity a major policy initiative as governor. He ran for the GOP presidential nomination in 2008, capturing strong support from evangelical Christians and winning the Iowa caucuses. But Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), won most of the subsequent primaries, and Huckabee withdrew from the race that March. His supporters expected him to run again in 2012, but he declined. Since then, he has continued to influence the conservative movement as a charismatic public speaker and radio and television host. Huckabee's religion has played a prominent role in his political career and shaped him as a staunch social conservative. He wrote in his memoir, \"From Hope to Higher Ground,\" that his work as a pastor helps him understand how politics and policy affect people. \"My experience dealing every day with real people who were genuinely affected by policies created by government gave me a deep understanding of the fragility of the human spirit and vulnerability of so many families who struggled from week to week,\" he wrote. \"I was in the ICU at 2 a.m. with families faced with the decision to disconnect a respirator on their loved one; I counseled fifteen-year-old pregnant girls who were afraid to tell their parents about their condition; I spent hours hearing the grief of women who had been physically and emotionally clobbered by an abusive husband.\" As governor, Huckabee signed a ban on gay marriage (which was overturned by a federal judge last year), and he has been outspoken in his opposition against states legalizing marriage equality. Last year, he argued that he's on \"the right side of the Bible.\" \"You've got to understand, this for me is not about the right side or the wrong side of history, this is the right side of the Bible, and unless God rewrites it, edits it, sends it down with his signature on it, it's not my book to change. Folks, that's why I stand where I stand,\" he said. According to HuffPost Pollster, Huckabee falls behind a few other GOP 2016 candidates, trailing Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Ted Cruz (Texas), and Marco Rubio (Fla.), but slightly edging out former neurosurgeon Ben Carson.",

        "body": " FERGUSON, Mo. \u2014 Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. arrived in St. Louis on Wednesday, meeting with community leaders and federal investigators even as local law enforcement officials said they were hopeful that they had turned a corner in calming the restive community of Ferguson after 12 days of protests and unrest. Mr. Holder\u2019s first stop was at a community college, where he met with people who told him about their own personal experiences with the local police, some of which they said helped fuel the rage that was ultimately ignited by the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer on Aug. 9. There were more protests planned throughout the day and into the evening, but Capt. Ronald S. Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol said he believed they had reached \u201ca turning point.\u201d Captain Johnson, whose agency is overseeing security here, said there were only sporadic problems on Tuesday night, and none of the wide-scale looting and confrontations that had erupted on other nights. Still, the police did make 47 arrests overnight. As the tension on the street seemed to ease, the focus turned to the investigation into the shooting death of Michael Brown. A grand jury has been convened and was scheduled to meet Wednesday to begin hearing evidence, said Edward Magee, a spokesman for Robert P. McCulloch, the prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County. Protesters gathered outside Mr. McCulloch\u2019s office on Wednesday, calling for him to step aside. They argued that he could not be impartial because his father, a police officer, was shot and killed by a black man while on duty when Mr. McCulloch was a child. Mr. McCulloch, speaking to a local radio station, categorically rejected that notion. \u201cI know the pain the Brown family is going through right now,\u201d he said. He said he has only one interest: conducting a fair and thorough investigation. But he acknowledged that Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri has the power to appoint a new prosecutor. \u201cAnyone who wants me off the case needs to call up the governor and express their opinion to him,\u201d Mr. McCulloch told KTRS radio. By failing to act, Mr. McCulloch said, the governor \u201cundermines everything except the cover he has pulled over his head.\u201d He told him to \u201cman up\u201d and make a decision so that the case will not be further delayed. Mr. Magee cautioned that it could take weeks for the grand jury to consider all of the evidence. He said that Officer Darren Wilson, who shot Mr. Brown, had been interviewed by police investigators and would be given the opportunity to testify. The Justice Department, meanwhile, has started a separate inquiry. More than 40 F.B.I. agents have been dispatched to Ferguson, and Mr. Holder said they are not only investigating the shooting but also looking for any broad patterns of civil rights violations. In an open letter to the people of Ferguson, Mr. Holder said he understood the desire of residents for an \u201cindependent\u201d inquiry. \u201cThis is my pledge to the people of Ferguson: Our investigation into this matter will be full, it will be fair, and it will be independent,\u201d Mr. Holder wrote in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \u201cAnd beyond the investigation itself, we will work with the police, civil rights leaders, and members of the public to ensure that this tragedy can give rise to new understanding \u2014 and robust action \u2014 aimed at bridging persistent gaps between law enforcement officials and the communities we serve.\u201d The frustrations in the community have been fueled in part by the slow pace with which the authorities have released information. In a sign of just how deep the distrust runs, there were three separate autopsies performed on Mr. Brown\u2019s body: one by the county medical examiner, one by a private pathologist hired by the family, and one by federal authorities. In addition to the many lingering questions about the shooting, the local authorities have also come under criticism for how they have handled the protests. Norm Stamper, the former Seattle police chief who was in charge during the protests that rocked that city in 1999, said that the wrong tone was set from the first day in Ferguson. \u201cThe basic perspective that I have over this whole thing, dating back to the shooting incident itself, what we had were largely peaceful vigils and protests that were met with police tactics that were highly aggressive and militaristic,\u201d he said. \u201cThat response ignited what we have seen all week.\u201d He reserved his harshest criticism for the use of tear gas by the police \u2014 a mistake he said he made in Seattle and one he regrets to this day. Since the first day of protests in Ferguson, the authorities shifted their response almost daily, adding to the sense that the situation was out of control. On one day, protesters were told to gather in one place. Another day, they were told to keep moving. Then a curfew was imposed. The next night, there was no curfew. The local police were in control; then another unit took over. The National Guard was finally brought in to try to temper the unrest, but its role was not exactly clear. \u201cYou get governors and police chiefs and everyone gnashing their teeth,\u201d Mr. Stamper said. \u201cEven the protesters are commenting on that: what are they doing?\u201d On Tuesday night, however, it seemed that some of that energy had gone from the streets. And the police also seemed more restrained, refraining from using tear gas. The evening began in a familiar fashion: Demonstrators marched along the street and chanted \u201cHands up! Don\u2019t shoot!\u201d and other slogans that have become common here since Mr. Brown\u2019s death. The authorities made at least 47 arrests after demonstrators tossed bottles toward police officers, some of whom used pepper spray to subdue some protesters. In some instances, teams of officers abruptly entered the crowd, detained a single person whom they had apparently focused on, and returned to West Florissant Avenue, where many of the recent confrontations have occurred. Although law enforcement officers in riot gear eyed the protesters while a police helicopter occasionally circled the city, there were no signs of trouble for long stretches of the evening. When a demonstration ended shortly before midnight, many of the demonstrators prayed. \u201cNow that\u2019s what I call a good protest,\u201d Jonathan Smith, 45, said. \u201cEnding in a prayer, no gas in the air.\u201d",

But I am talking about his worldview, the way he addresses problems in this country, and they're different than most people view it in America.\" In a speech to Tea Party conservatives on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio, Santorum had dismissed Obama\u2019s politics as being based in \u201csome phony theology.\u201d \"It's not about you. It's not about your quality of life. It's not about your jobs,\" Santorum said. \"It's about some phony ideal, some phony theology. Oh, not a theology based on the Bible. A different theology.\" An incredulous Bob Schieffer began his interview with Santorum Sunday by asking, \"What in the world were you talking about?\" \"I was talking about the radical environmentalists,\" Santorum said, suggesting that they believe man should protect the earth, rather than \"steward its resources.\" \"I think that is a phony ideal. I don't believe that's what we're here to do ... We're not here to serve the earth. That is not the objective, man is the objective.\" Earlier in the day on Saturday, Santorum had also said that health insurance plans shouldn\u2019t be required to cover prenatal testing, because that testing results in more abortions, as well as contending that government-run public education was \u201canachronistic.\u201d \"Free prenatal testing ends up in more abortions and therefore less care that has to be done, because we cull the ranks of the disabled in our society,\" Santorum told the Ohio Christian Alliance conference. Asked by Schieffer about his claims that prenatal testing leads to more abortions, Santorum insisted that this was \"a fact.\" \"We're talking about specifically prenatal testing, and specifically amniocentesis, which is a procedure that actually creates a risk of having a miscarriage when you have it, and is done for the purposes of identifying maladies of a child in the womb. And in many cases -- and in fact in most cases -- most physicians recommend, if there is a problem, they recommend abortion,\" Santorum said. Santorum had said that because of this trend, health insurance providers should not be forced to make the procedures available free of charge. Santorum also told Schieffer that government-provided education was not working and that the process ought to be customizable, like buying a car. \"I'm saying that local communities and parents should be the ones in control over public education, certainly not the federal government, and I think the state governments have not done a particularly good job in public education, either,\" Santorum said. Buying a car, by contrast he said, is \"designed to meet the needs of a customer. Federally or state-run education is not designed to meet the needs of the customer.\" Speaking earlier on ABC's \"This Week\" about Santorum's remarks, Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs called his rhetoric \"well over the line.\" \"I think it's time in our politics that we get rid of this mindset that if we disagree, we have to disqualify each other,\" Gibbs said. \"I think if you make comments like that, you make comments that are well over the line,\" he added. \"I think the GOP race has been, in many cases, a race to the bottom.\"",

Todd Akin to give up his bid for Senate over his controversial comments on rape, as the Republican congressman continued to hold his ground and vowed to stay in the race. Romney added his voice after five past and present Missouri Republican senators urged Akin to step aside. In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, they said his presence does not serve \"the national interest.\" \"The issues at stake are too big, and this election is simply too important. The right decision is to step aside,\" they said. The statement came from Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, and former Sens. John Ashcroft, Kit Bond, John Danforth and Jim Talent Romney released a statement late Tuesday saying: \"As I said yesterday, Todd Akin's comments were offensive and wrong and he should very seriously consider what course would be in the best interest of our country. Today, his fellow Missourians urged him to step aside, and I think he should accept their counsel and exit the Senate race.\" Akin, though, told Fox News host Mike Huckabee on his radio show Tuesday afternoon that he's staying in. \"I believe that we can win this,\" Akin said, citing a \"tremendous outpouring of support\" from individual donors even as party heavyweights freeze him out. The Republican congressman is facing a 5 p.m. deadline to withdraw -- after that, he would need a court order to have his name removed from the ballot. But Akin rebuffed calls late Monday to step aside and let another Republican candidate take his place. Instead, his campaign released a new ad in which Akin looks into the camera and addresses the controversy surrounding his remarks. \"Rape is an evil act. I used the wrong words in the wrong way and for that I apologize,\" he said in the ad. \"As the father of two daughters, I want tough justice for predators. I have a compassionate heart for the victims of sexual assault. And I pray for them. The fact is, rape can lead to pregnancy. The truth is, rape has many victims. \"The mistake I made was in the words I said, not in the heart I hold. I ask for your forgiveness,\" he said. The video was released after Akin canceled a scheduled television interview Monday night. Akin's ad, and claims Monday that he's \"going to stay in,\" defied Republican Party leaders who are nervous the controversy could imperil their chances of taking control of the Senate after the November elections. Akin is challenging Democratic Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill in a race considered key to a GOP Senate majority come 2013. A source within the National Republican Senatorial Committee told Fox News that Sen. John Cornyn, head of the Senate GOP campaign arm, already has told Akin that if he stays in the race, the $5 million set aside for the Missouri race will be withdrawn. Cornyn, according to the source, told him the party is concerned his presence in the race could hurt Republicans' chances of winning the Senate majority. Akin made the remarks in an interview with Fox affiliate KTVI. He claimed a woman's body can typically fend off pregnancy during a \"legitimate rape,\" as he argued against allowing abortions in cases of rape, claiming such pregnancies are uncommon in the first place. \"It seems to me first of all, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare,\" Akin told KTVI. \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\" Top Senate leaders including Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell have condemned Akin's comments. \"What he said is just flat wrong in addition to being wildly offensive to any victim of sexual abuse,\" McConnell said. \"Although Rep. Akin has apologized, I believe he should take time with his family to consider whether this statement will prevent him from effectively representing our party in this critical election.\" Republican Sen. Scott Brown, who's in a tough race against Democrat Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts, was the first Republican senator to call on Akin to withdraw from the race. Akin apologized for his remarks Monday. He tweeted Monday afternoon: \"I am in this race to win.\"",

Trump told NBC News in an interview that plans to decide by June whether to run. He said that if he\u2019s nominated, \u201cI\u2019d like to beat him straight up,\u201d not on the basis of the birth issue. A national NBC/WSJ poll released yesterday shows Trump tied for 2nd with Mike Huckabee in the 2012 GOP primary field at 17 percent (Mitt Romney leads the pack at 21 percent). NBC further notes, \u201cStrikingly, Trump . . . finishes first among Tea Party supporters (at 20 percent), followed by Romney (17 percent), Huckabee (14 percent), Palin (12 percent) and Gingrich (9 percent).\u201d Trump said he didn't introduce the citizenship issue, but was asked about it during an interview a month ago. Since then, he said he's looked into it and believes \"there is a big possibility\" Obama may have violated the Constitution. \"I want to see the birth certificate,\" said Trump in an interview on NBC's \"Today\" show, according to TIME. \"How come his own family doesn't know which hospital he was born in? How come-- forget about birth certificates. Let's say there's no birth certificate. How come in the hospital itself, okay? This is one of the...in the hospital itself, there's no records of his birth. In other words, it doesn't say how much they paid, where is the doctor, here's your room bill.\" Officials in Hawaii have certified that Obama was born in that state. But \"birthers\" have demanded additional proof, asserting he could have been born in Kenya. \"I'm not convinced that he has one,\" Trump said of the birth certificate issue. \"Today\" show host Meredith Vieira asked Trump, \"You've been privy to all of this to know this?\" His response: \"Well, I have people that actually have been studying it and they cannot believe what they're talking.\" The remarks from the potential presidential candidate prompted Vieira to ask Trump if he had people on the ground in Hawaii searching for proof of the president's citizenship. He signaled he did, saying, \"And they cannot believe what they're finding. And I'm serious.\" When asked how genuine his presidential ambition is, Trump said, \"I always take things seriously, but I've never taken it seriously like this.\" \"I wish I didn't have to do it,\" he said. \"I wish this was the greatest place in the world,\" Trump said, but he also said jobs are disappearing in the United States and that Obama has given the country \"a terrible presidency.\" Trump said that if the current fight over budget issues forces a shutdown, \"I think the president will be blamed.\" He accused Obama of carrying out a confusing policy on the civil war in Libya, saying \"nobody knows what's happening, and now it looks like (Libyan strongman Moammar) Gadhafi is going to beat the United States.\" \"I'm only interested in Libya if we get the oil,\" Trump said. He said Obama \"doesn't have a doctrine (on foreign affairs.) Foreign affairs is, we take care of ourselves first\" Of Obama, he said, \"I want him to do well. ...

In a 48-page indictment released by the Justice Department, Mr. Hunter, Republican of California, and his wife, Margaret, are charged with converting more than $250,000 in campaign funds to pay for personal expenses and filing false campaign finance records with the Federal Election Commission. Mr. Hunter, 41, becomes the second Republican congressman to be indicted this month. Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York, was indicted on insider trading charges, and announced days later that he had suspended his re-election campaign.

Mr. Collins, who is accused of passing insider information to his son about a drug company on whose board he served, has said he expects to be \u201cfully vindicated and exonerated.\u201d A spokesman for Mr. Hunter, Michael Harrison, said Tuesday that the congressman \u201cbelieves this action is purely politically motivated,\u201d and referred a reporter to a letter that Mr. Hunter\u2019s lawyer, Gregory A.

Mr. Vega, anticipating an indictment, asserted in the letter that two prosecutors involved in the investigation had attended a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton, and complained that bringing charges so close to the election would effectively deliver a \u201csolidly Republican\u201d House seat into Democratic hands. The back-to-back indictments are all but certain to give ammunition to Democrats, who have been promising to clean up corruption in Washington if voters give them control of the House. And for California Republicans, it has immediate implications, expanding from seven to eight the field of Republican-held seats being seriously targeted by Democrats. Mr. Hunter cannot take his name off the ballot, according to a spokesman for the California secretary of state, and California does not allow write-in candidates. Mr. Hunter easily won California\u2019s nonpartisan primary with 48 percent of the vote; the next highest vote-getter, Ammar Campa-Najjar, a Democrat, took only 17 percent. Despite that, Democrats have long thought they could make a play for Mr. Hunter\u2019s seat, especially if he were indicted. At the very least, the indictment will require Republicans to spend money to defend the seat. \u201cThe division, chaos and corruption in Washington has gone too far,\u201d Mr. Campa-Najjar said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s indictment confirms just how deep this corruption can reach when someone like Duncan Hunter Jr. is in it for himself instead of representing the people.\u201d The indictment details scores of instances, beginning in 2009 and continuing through 2016, in which the Justice Department said the Hunters spent campaign money on themselves. The department said that the improper use of campaign funds continued despite \u201cnumerous warnings\u201d and \u201crepeated inquiries\u201d from Mr. Hunter\u2019s campaign treasurer about questionable purchases. \u201cThe indictment alleges that Congressman Hunter and his wife repeatedly dipped into campaign coffers as if they were personal bank accounts, and falsified F.E.C. campaign finance reports to cover their tracks,\u201d Adam L. Braverman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of California, said in a statement, referring to the Federal Election Commission. \u201cElected representatives should jealously guard the public\u2019s trust, not abuse their positions for personal gain,\u201d Mr. Braverman added. \u201cToday\u2019s indictment is a reminder that no one is above the law.\u201d Beyond the family vacations and private school tuition, the indictment said expenses included dental work, theater tickets, and domestic and international travel for almost a dozen relatives, as well as \u201ctens of thousands of dollars on smaller purchases, including fast food, movie tickets, golf outings, video games, coffee, groceries, home utilities and expensive meals,\u201d according to a statement released by the Justice Department. The \u201ccabin rabbit transport fees\u201d were first reported in January 2017 by a California newspaper, The Press-Enterprise. To conceal their personal spending, the Hunters mischaracterized the purchases as \u201ccampaign travel,\u201d \u201cdinner with volunteers/contributors,\u201d \u201ctoy drives,\u201d \u201cteacher/parent and supporter events,\u201d \u201cgift cards\u201d for charitable donations and \u201cgift basket items,\u201d the statement said. Family dental bills paid with campaign funds were characterized as a charitable contribution to \u201cSmiles for Life.\u201d Theater tickets were mischaracterized as \u201choliday gift certificates.\u201d Tickets for the family to see the Irish dance show Riverdance at the San Diego Civic Theater became \u201cSan Diego Civic Center for Republican Women Federated/Fund-raising.\u201d The Hunters are scheduled to be arraigned Thursday morning in San Diego. A former Marine in Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr. Hunter was first elected in 2008 to a seat held by his father, and now serves on the House Armed Services Committee. He was for a time considered as a possible choice for defense secretary or another top job in the Trump administration, and told The San Diego Union-Tribune days after Mr. Trump\u2019s election that he wanted to restore \u201ca warrior culture, a warrior mentality\u201d to the government. By March 2017, when the Justice Department opened its criminal investigation, Mr. Hunter was already being investigated by the House Ethics Committee. His lawyer said then that the congressman intended to cooperate fully and had already repaid about $60,000 to his campaign to correct for mistaken payments for personal items.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose experience and stability were widely seen as a balance to an unpredictable president, resigned Thursday in protest of President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances. Mr. Mattis had repeatedly told friends and aides over recent months that he viewed his responsibility to protect the United States\u2019 1.3 million active-duty troops as worth the concessions necessary as defense secretary to a mercurial president. But on Thursday, in an extraordinary rebuke of the president, he decided that Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw roughly 2,000 American troops from Syria was a step too far. Officials said Mr. Mattis went to the White House with his resignation letter already written, but nonetheless made a last attempt at persuading the president to reverse his decision about Syria, which Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday over the objections of his senior advisers. Mr. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, was rebuffed. Returning to the Pentagon, he asked aides to print out 50 copies of his resignation letter and distribute them around the building. \u201cMy views on treating allies with respect and also being cleareyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held,\u201d Mr. Mattis wrote. \u201cBecause you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.\u201d His resignation came as Congress appeared to be hurtling toward a government shutdown and as a deep market slump became even worse over fears of continuing government turmoil. With the ousting this month of John F. Kelly as White House chief of staff, Mr. Mattis was the last of Mr. Trump\u2019s old-guard national security team \u2014 leaving policy in the hands of Mike Pompeo, the president\u2019s second secretary of state, and John R. Bolton, the third White House national security adviser. Mr. Trump said that Mr. Mattis, 68, will leave at the end of February, and that Mr. Mattis \u201cwas a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations.\u201d The president said he would name a replacement soon. As Mr. Mattis was handing in his resignation, the Pentagon was preparing to draw down forces in Afghanistan. Two Defense Department officials said Thursday that about 7,000 troops will be withdrawn in the coming months \u2014 cutting in half the number of American forces there \u2014 in an early step to ending the United States\u2019 involvement in the 17-year war. \u201cThis is scary,\u201d Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a Twitter post. He called Mr. Mattis \u201can island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration.\u201d Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, called it \u201ca sad day for America because Secretary Mattis was giving advice the President needs to hear.\u201d He added that Mr. Mattis \u201crightly believes that Russia and China are clear adversaries and that we are at war with jihadists across the globe who plot to kill Americans at home.\u201d Mr. Mattis\u2019s resignation letter was the sharpest, and most public, protest from inside the Trump administration over the president\u2019s rejection of the alliances and relationships that have underpinned American security since the end of World War II. It was also the first resignation over a major national security issue by a leading cabinet member since 1980, when Cyrus Vance quit as secretary of state. Mr. Vance left over President Jimmy Carter\u2019s decision to attempt a rescue effort for American hostages in Iran that Mr. Vance considered ill-advised and that ended in tragedy. Mr. Mattis\u2019s letter did not single out any decision. Instead, it condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to the world as destructive to American influence and power. He said the core of American national interests lay in \u201cproviding effective leadership to our alliances,\u201d and specifically described the importance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a defense alliance Mr. Trump has often derided. Mr. Mattis also praised the \u201cDefeat ISIS\u201d coalition that Mr. Trump just abandoned in Syria. But Mr. Mattis\u2019s core complaint was that Mr. Trump had lost sight of the importance of the competition for global power with Russia and China, who want \u201ca world consistent with their authoritarian model.\u201d Mr. Mattis was the primary author of a new American defense strategy whose central goal was to take on \u201crevisionist\u201d powers \u2014 an approach that some of Mr. Trump\u2019s former advisers say the president never fully comprehended. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of Syria, which was opposed by virtually every high-level administration official but lauded by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, was the last straw. Among his other concerns, Mr. Mattis viewed the withdrawal as abandoning Kurdish fighters and other American allies, and as ceding critical territory to Russia and Iran. No senior Pentagon official has defended the withdrawal publicly, despite requests from the White House. As a result, Mr. Trump appeared by himself in a video \u2014 which he tweeted Wednesday evening \u2014 announcing victory over the Islamic State. During Thursday\u2019s meeting at the White House, officials said that Mr. Trump again asked Mr. Mattis to publicly endorse the Syria decision. Mr. Mattis refused. The president\u2019s tweets announcing the departure of his defense secretary shocked officials at the Pentagon, who as recently as Thursday afternoon were insisting that Mr. Mattis had no intention of resigning. Mr. Trump\u2019s selection of Mr. Mattis as his Pentagon chief only weeks after his 2016 election was widely praised. The career Marine was respected among allies and adversaries and on Capitol Hill, and he was beloved in the Pentagon as a protector against a president with scant understanding of his own role as commander in chief. Mr. Mattis commanded Marines in Afghanistan and in the 2003 invasion of Iraq before becoming the head of United States Central Command, overseeing all American troops in the Middle East. Though a colorful, hard-charging advocate of aggressive offensive action, Mr. Mattis viewed a tough American posture overseas as a way to deter war, not to start them, with potential foes like Iran. He favored working with allies, and often spoke of how difficult it was to conduct American policy without the benefit of friends. During his job interview with Mr. Trump in 2016, Mr. Mattis said he did not believe in torturing terrorism suspects to get information because he thought he could get more out of detainees by talking to them over a pack of cigarettes and a beer. The relationship between Mr. Mattis and Mr. Trump had deteriorated for months. The widely accepted narrative that Mr. Mattis was the adult in the room when at the White House came to annoy the president. In October, Mr. Trump accused Mr. Mattis of being a Democrat \u2014 a charge akin to treason in the current Republican administration. As defense secretary, Mr. Mattis oversaw the world\u2019s most powerful military, supervising active-duty troops based in the United States and deployed worldwide, including in war zones in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and on the Saudi border with Yemen. There are also around 25,000 American troops in South Korea, where they have served for generations as a deterrent against North Korea. As with Mr. Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the split with Mr. Mattis was a full turn in a relationship that once appeared strong. In Mr. Mattis\u2019s early days as defense secretary, he often ate dinner with the president in the White House residence. Over hamburgers, and with the help of briefing folders, Mr. Mattis explained to Mr. Trump key points about the United States\u2019 relationships with allies. But Mr. Mattis also quietly slow-walked a number of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals, including banning transgender troops, starting  a Space Force and putting on a costly military parade. In each case, he went through the motions of acquiescing to the White House \u2014 and then buried the plans in Defense Department red tape.",

        "body": " Colorado's top cop defends pot law after challenges from neighboring states Denver (AP) \u2013 Colorado's top law enforcement official promises to vigorously defend the state's historic law legalizing marijuana after Nebraska and Oklahoma asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, saying the drug is freely flowing into neighboring states. The two states filed a lawsuit seeking a court order to prevent Colorado from enforcing the measure known as Amendment 64, which was approved by voters in 2012 and allows recreational marijuana for adults over 21. The complaint says the measure runs afoul of federal law and therefore violates the Constitution's supremacy clause, which says federal laws trump state laws. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers said the lawsuit was without merit. \"Because neighboring states have expressed concern about Colorado-grown marijuana coming into their states, we are not entirely surprised by this action,\" he said. \"However, it appears the plaintiffs' primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana, as opposed to choices made by the voters of Colorado.\" The lawsuit says Colorado marijuana flows into neighboring states undermining their efforts to enforce their anti-marijuana laws. \"This contraband has been heavily trafficked into our state,\" Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning said at a news conference in Lincoln. \"While Colorado reaps millions from the sale of pot, Nebraska taxpayers have to bear the cost.\" Colorado has raised more than $60 million in taxes, licenses and fees from medical and recreational marijuana, which has been sold in stores since January. The lawsuit says the sales have strained Nebraska and Oklahoma's finances and legal systems. Police are spending more time and money making arrests, housing inmates, impounding vehicles, seizing drugs and handling other problems related to Colorado pot. Bruning, a Republican, blamed U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for failing to enforce the federal law's ban on drugs in Colorado. In a policy statement last year, the U.S. Justice Department noted it doesn't have the resources to police all violations of federal marijuana law. It laid out eight federal law enforcement priorities that states need to protect if they want to authorize \"marijuana-related conduct.\" They include keeping marijuana in-state \u2014 something Oklahoma and Nebraska says Colorado has failed to do. The suit doesn't contain statistics to support the claim. Law enforcement agencies have long said anecdotally that they are feeling the impacts of Colorado's legal weed, making more marijuana arrests and seizing more of the drug. But there's no way to know exactly how much legal pot is leaving Colorado. The Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area wrote in a recent report that the amount of Colorado pot seized on highways increased from an annual average of 2,763 pounds between 2005 and 2008 to a yearly average of 3,690 pounds from 2009 to 2013. The weed was headed for at least 40 different states. Scotts Bluff County Sheriff Mark Overman, in western Nebraska, said Colorado marijuana is extra potent, making it worth more in his region and giving sellers a greater financial incentive to do business there. \"I think this is overdue, and I think other states should jump on board,\" Overman said of the lawsuit. \"I'm very frustrated. I take an oath of office, as does every other police officer in this country. I don't just get to pick and choose which laws I enforce.\" Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper told The Denver Post he spoke with Nebraska and Oklahoma officials about their concerns. \"I'm not sure filing a lawsuit is the most constructive way to find a solution to whatever issues they are,\" he said. Legal scholars say it's too early to know how the Supreme Court might handle the case or if it will even accept it. \"Right now, these regulations exist in legal no-man's-land,\" said Sam Kamin, a University of Denver law professor. \"It's incredibly unusual for a state to be suing another state. (The lawsuit) certainly was a surprise to me given the movement at the federal level, which seems to be in favor of allowing states to experiment.\" It was unclear if other neighboring states would take similar action. Attorneys general in Utah and New Mexico said they had no immediate plans to join the suit. Brian Vicente, a Colorado attorney and legalization advocate who wrote Amendment 64, said the challenge is \"political grandstanding\" without merit. He said 23 states have enacted medical marijuana laws, and none have been overturned because of federal law. \"I think it shows they are on the wrong side of history,\" Vicente said. \"Colorado voters passed this measure, and more and more states are passing these laws. If the attorney general has a problem with how federal laws are being enforced he should bring that up with the U.S. attorney.\"",

        "body": " Nebraska, Oklahoma File Federal Suit Against Colorado Over Marijuana Legalization The states of Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a federal lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court Thursday, claiming that Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law. \"Federal law undisputedly prohibits the production and sale of marijuana,\" Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning said Thursday in a statement. \"Colorado has undermined the United States Constitution, and I hope the U.S. Supreme Court will uphold our constitutional principles.\" But Colorado Attorney General John Suthers isn't backing down. In a statement, he said he intends to defend the state's marijuana laws. \u201cBecause neighboring states have expressed concern about Colorado-grown marijuana coming into their states, we are not entirely surprised by this action,\" Suthers said. \"However, it appears the plaintiffs\u2019 primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana, as opposed to choices made by the voters of Colorado. We believe this suit is without merit and we will vigorously defend against it in the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d Bruning, along with Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, argue that under the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause, Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional because marijuana remains illegal under federal law. The clause states that in general, federal law takes precedence over state law. \"The illegal products being distributed in Colorado are being trafficked across state lines thereby injuring neighboring states like Oklahoma and Nebraska,\" Pruitt said in a statement. The regulation of recreational marijuana -- as seen in programs currently in place in Colorado and Washington state, as well as those that will soon go into effect in Oregon and Alaska -- remains illegal under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act. The states that have legalized marijuana or softened penalties for possession have only been able to do so because of federal guidance urging federal prosecutors to refrain from targeting state-legal marijuana operations. Colorado voters approved Amendment 64, legalizing recreational marijuana in the state, in 2012. The first retail marijuana shops opened their doors on New Years Day 2014. To date, 23 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical purposes. Four states have legalized recreational marijuana, along with voters in D.C. -- though the D.C. measure is the subject of a congressional Republican effort to block its implementation. With a majority of Americans now supporting marijuana legalization, and with states continuing to pass legalization laws, it seems unlikely that the federal government would push back against the legalizations. But it's not impossible. If the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of Nebraska and Oklahoma, all state marijuana laws, in any form, could be in jeopardy of being unraveled. Harvard economist Jeff Miron, a vocal supporter of marijuana policy reform, highlighted the precarious nature of state marijuana laws in a November op-ed for CNN, saying that Congress needs to act now on federal marijuana policy. \"Despite the compelling case for legalization, and progress toward legalization at the state level, ultimate success is not assured,\" Miron wrote. \"Federal law still prohibits marijuana, and existing jurisprudence (Gonzales v. Raich 2005) holds that federal law trumps state law when it comes to marijuana prohibition. So far, the federal government has mostly taken a hands-off approach to state medicalizations and legalizations, but in January 2017, the country will have a new president. That person could order the attorney general to enforce federal prohibition regardless of state law.\" Kevin Sabet, president of anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, applauded the action by Nebraska and Oklahoma. \"We support this action by the attorneys general of Oklahoma and Nebraska because Colorado's decisions regarding marijuana are not without consequences to neighboring states, and indeed all Americans,\" Sabet said. \"The legalization of marijuana is clearly in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and is not implemented in a vacuum.\" Mason Tvert, communications director for Marijuana Policy Project, told The Huffington Post that MPP agrees with Suthers' opinion that the suit is \"without merit.\" \"Nebraska officials are acting like bullies, and they have no business trying to dictate Colorado's marijuana laws,\" Tvert said to HuffPost. \"They are wasting their taxpayers\u2019 dollars by filing this suit and forcing Coloradans to pick up the bill for defending our state against it. Colorado's top law enforcement officials have better things to do and you\u2019d think Nebraska\u2019s would, as well. These guys are on the wrong side of history.\" Marijuana Industry Group's Mike Elliott echoed Tvert's sentiments, adding that despite the multi-decade federal war on drugs, marijuana remains \"universally available\" -- including in Nebraska and Oklahoma. \"If Nebraska and Oklahoma succeed, they will put the violent criminal organizations back in charge,\" Elliott said. Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.), a vocal supporter of drug policy reform who has sponsored multiple bills seeking protection for state-legal marijuana businesses and advocated full-scale federal legalization of the drug, told HuffPost that Nebraska and Oklahoma attempting to overturn the will of Colorado's voters is \"outrageous.\" \"Our federalist system is based on individual states of being able to enact policies that benefit their citizens, without the interference of other states,\" Polis said.",

        "body": " Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he understands why many black Americans distrust the police as he made a one-day swing through the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo., where a black teenager was fatally shot by a white police officer almost two weeks earlier. Holder made the comments during a meeting with about 50 community leaders at the Florissant campus of St. Louis Community College in which he heard about their own issues with law enforcement officials. Ferguson has endured more than a week of unrest since the August 9 death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was shot by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. The Obama administration intended the trip to underscore its commitment to civil rights in general and the Ferguson case in particular. \"I understand that mistrust,\" Holder said. \"I am the attorney general of the United States. But I am also a black man.\" The attorney general then described how he was stopped twice on the New Jersey Turnpike and accused of speeding. Police searched his car, going through the trunk and looking under the seats. \"I remember how humiliating that was and how angry I was and the impact it had on me,\" Holder said. Holder also described how once, while living in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, he was running to catch a movie with his cousin when a squad car rolled up and flashed its lights at the pair. The officer yelled, \"Where are you going? Hold it!\" Holder recalled. His cousin \"started mouthing off,\" and Holder urged him to be quiet. \"We negotiate the whole thing, and we walk to our movie. At the time that he stopped me, I was a federal prosecutor. I wasn't a kid,\" he said. While in Ferguson, Holder met with federal officials investigating the case, as well as Brown's parents. He also met with Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who has been in charge of security in Ferguson for nearly a week. The National Guard is also helping to keep the peace. On Wednesday night, a diminished number of protesters marched around a single block in Ferguson as a thunderstorm filled the sky with lighting and dumped rain. Police still stood guard, but many wore regular uniforms rather than riot gear. Johnson said there were six arrests Wednesday, compared to 47 the previous night. He called it \"a very good night,\" and said Holder's visit had let people know their voices had been heard. In nearby Clayton, a grand jury began hearing evidence to determine whether Wilson should be charged in Brown's death. A spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch said there was no timeline for the process, but it could take weeks. Outside the St. Louis County Justice Center, where the grand jury convened, two dozen protesters gathered in a circle for a prayer, chanted and held signs urging McCulloch to step aside. McCulloch's deep family connections to police have been cited by some black leaders who question his ability to be impartial in the case. McCulloch's father, mother, brother, uncle and cousin all worked for the St. Louis Police Department, and his father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect. The prosecutor, who is white, has insisted his background will have no bearing on the handling of the Brown case, which has touched off days of nighttime protests during which authorities used tear gas and rubber bullets to clear the streets. On Wednesday, police said an officer had been suspended for pointing a semi-automatic assault rifle at demonstrators, then cursing and threatening to kill one of them. A protester captured the exchange on video Tuesday and posted it to YouTube and other websites.",

        "body": " Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hasn\u2019t been shy in recent days about the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, joking that she might move to New Zealand if it ever happens. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what this place would be \u2015 I can\u2019t imagine what the country would be \u2015 with Donald Trump as our president,\u201d Ginsburg told The New York Times in an article published Sunday. \u201cFor the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be \u2015 I don\u2019t even want to contemplate that.\u201d That tracks a comment she made in a separate interview with The Associated Press, when the justice stopped short of noting she\u2019d rather have presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton making future appointments to the Supreme Court. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about that possibility,\u201d Ginsburg said when asked to consider Trump in the role of appointer-in-chief.  Now a number of legal academics and Supreme Court observers are raising questions about the propriety of Ginsburg\u2019s candor and what it might mean for the court\u2019s integrity \u2015 with some suggesting she might have to recuse herself from considering any Trump-related case that reaches the high court. \u201cThe other justices should hold an intervention, and tell her to be quiet or step down,\u201d wrote Josh Blackman, a Houston College of Law professor who frequently writes about the high court. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny anymore.\u201d He added that Ginsburg\u2019s comments are \u201cbeyond the pale.\u201d Rick Hasen, another avid court watcher who specializes in election law, wrote that Ginsburg\u2019s statements could very well lead a \u201creasonable person\u201d to question her impartiality in a future politically charged case. \u201cI think this is ultimately a question for judicial ethicists, but I do think following these comments it is a legitimate question to raise, should Donald Trump\u2019s campaign come to the Court with any legal questions before the election,\u201d he wrote in his widely read Election Law Blog. Dmitry Bam, a professor at the University of Maine School of Law who has written on judicial recusals and ethics, said \u201cthere is little question that she has crossed a line.\u201d \u201cFor a court that cares a great deal about appearances, this certainly creates the appearance that justices take sides in elections,\u201d Bam wrote in an email. \u201cAnd if Trump v. Clinton arises in the fall, I would say that there is at the very least an appearance of bias if Justice Ginsburg participates.\u201d Under federal law, justices must step aside from cases where their \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d \u2015 and they did so in 180 cases during the court\u2019s last term, according to a new analysis by Fix the Court, a group that pushes for structural reform at the Supreme Court. Fix the Court found that the bulk of recent recusals were due to the justices\u2019 prior work as appellate judges or in government positions. Other recusals were related to stock ownership and family ties to judges or lawyers who participated in earlier stages of the cases. But recusals for political views or implicit support for certain positions are exceedingly rare, even in the face of a code of judicial conduct that guides federal judges on extra-judicial activities and how to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Even with that guidance and other self-imposed checks in place, the justices have time and again declined to step aside in cases of high political salience \u2015 most recently in the same-sex marriage cases, where Ginsburg and Justices Elena Kagan and Clarence Thomas all took part despite calls for them to recuse. \u201cI\u2019m not aware [that] any justice before has ever commented on the merits or demerits of a presidential candidate,\u201d said Ed Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a frequent contributor to the conservative National Review Online, where he has chronicled this episode and what he deems Ginsburg\u2019s \u201cremarkable record of indiscretions.\u201d \u201cI may very well share her concerns about Donald Trump ... but the ethics concerns don\u2019t depend on the soundness or unsoundness of the candidate,\u201d Whelan added. But what if this is less a question about ethics and more about wanting our judges to be candid about their positions and biases \u2015 and that the political process itself has done away with the veneer that the high court is entirely apolitical? \u201cMost people now recognize that judges are heavily influenced by their personal beliefs and experiences,\u201d said Bam, of the Maine School of Law. \u201cWe have watched one party refuse to hold hearings based the politics of the president and his potential nominees. Judges time their retirements to coincide with a certain party being in office. And the 5-4 decision in Bush v. Gore, along partisan lines, also shows the political nature of the court,\u201d Bam said. \u201cSo perhaps the pretense that judges are nonpartisan and apolitical does more harm than good.\u201d",

Trump in his speech at the Democratic National Convention this week \u2014 labeling him a public menace and hinting that he was not quite sane \u2014 it would be easy to think that the two billionaires had a rift going back many years. \u201cTrump says he wants to run the nation like he\u2019s run his business,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said on Wednesday. \u201cGod help us.\u201d But in all their time in New York City, their interactions have been limited, yet cordial, according to people who know both of them. They existed in different circles of New York\u2019s ultrarich: Mr. Bloomberg is known as a generous philanthropist; Mr. Trump appears to have been flinty in his giving. Mr. Bloomberg is a supporter of the arts and aligns himself with Manhattan\u2019s sophisticated cultural scene; Mr. Trump relishes in being crude. Mr. Bloomberg made his billions in finance and technology; Mr. Trump got his start in real estate before becoming a casino magnate and then a reality-show celebrity. Mr. Bloomberg is not overly ostentatious for a man of great wealth; Mr. Trump loves to show off his possessions. \u201cI\u2019ve been by Mike\u2019s side for 19 years, and I\u2019ve never met Donald Trump,\u201d said Kevin Sheekey, an adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, underscoring the extent to which the men were not close. \u201cTrump hasn\u2019t been part of the business, political or charitable community since the Koch administration. The only place Mike and Donald would have seen each other is on a golf course or on a TV set.\u201d On at least a few occasions, Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Trump met up on the golf links. In 2007, when Mr. Bloomberg was in the second of his three terms as mayor, the two played together in a charity event at Trump National Golf Club in the city\u2019s northern suburbs. An article in New York magazine described how Mr. Trump, Mr. Bloomberg, the comedian Billy Crystal and the former New York Yankees manager Joe Torre were set to play together in the lead foursome \u2014 but could not agree on who would go first. \u201cHow about the mayor starts it off in honor of the city?\u201d Mr. Trump was quoted as saying, playing peacemaker and showing deference to Mr. Bloomberg. Mr. Bloomberg also appeared twice on Mr. Trump\u2019s reality TV show, \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d in 2004 and 2008, in part as a way to demonstrate support for the show, which was produced in New York. And the men have a filial connection: acquaintances said that Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s daughter Georgina is friends with Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka. Mr. Trump, an avid user of Twitter, made positive comments about Mr. Bloomberg when he was in office. \u201cMike Bloomberg is doing a great job as mayor of New York City,\u201d he posted in 2012. In 2013, he praised Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s administration for choosing him to finish a stalled Bronx golf course project, and then wrote on Twitter about a ribbon-cutting with the mayor. In 2014, Mr. Trump tweeted congratulations at Georgina for winning an equestrian tournament. But the cordiality dissipated not long after Mr. Trump declared his candidacy. Mr. Bloomberg began exploring his own presidential bid, as an independent, in part to block Mr. Trump from being elected. And when Mr. Bloomberg ruled out running, he did so because he said he did not want his third-party candidacy to siphon enough votes to help Mr. Trump. \u201cAs a former Republican presidential campaign manager told me, Hillary has some baggage, but Trump is crazy,\u201d said Mr. Sheekey, who was involved in Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s explorative bid. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t fix crazy.\u201d Mr. Trump, typically, has not shied away from counterattacks. In a CNN interview in January, Mr. Trump voiced skepticism that Mr. Bloomberg was worth as much as Forbes magazine estimated and speculated that Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s company, which provides data terminals to financial firms and wealthy individuals, was vulnerable to competitors. \u201cWe used to be friends,\u201d Mr. Trump told CNN. \u201cI guess we\u2019re not friends anymore.\u201d",

        "body": " President Obama on Wednesday visited another bridge in need of repair \u2013 this one somewhat closer to home, between Washington and Virginia \u2014 to promote his job-creation proposals as the Senate began the latest partisan debate over his plans. But in pressing for approval of $60 billion in infrastructure spending, Mr. Obama took his biggest shot not at the measure\u2019s Republican opponents in the Senate, but at those in the House. He tweaked House Republicans for passing a resolution on Tuesday reaffirming the national motto, \u201cIn God We Trust,\u201d when they should be creating jobs. \u201cI trust in God,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cbut God wants to see us help ourselves by putting people back to work!\u201d Invoking patriotism as well as divine intervention \u2013 Mr. Obama stood against the backdrop of a giant American flag \u2013 he spoke before an audience that included unemployed construction workers, whose industry is among the hardest hit by the housing bust. \u201cI\u2019m joining many of these workers to say that it makes absolutely no sense when there\u2019s so much work to be done that they\u2019re not doing the work,\u201d Mr. Obama said to their applause. \u201cNot when there are so many roads and bridges and runways waiting to be repaired and waiting to be rebuilt.\u201d The president\u2019s short trip from the White House to the event stage on the Potomac riverfront came more than a month after he began campaigning throughout the country for his jobs plan, building public pressure on Republicans but winning no votes from them. Mr. Obama singled out the Republican leaders of the House and Senate \u2013 Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader \u2013 just as he did in September when he visited an aging bridge over the Ohio River that connects their two states. Mr. Obama said the two leaders and other Republicans had supported public-works investments in the past. But Republicans oppose Mr. Obama\u2019s $447 billion job-creation plan, which also includes tax cuts for workers and employers and state aid to avoid layoffs of teachers, police officers and firefighters, because the package would be paid for with higher taxes on those with taxable income of more than $1 million a year. For the same reason, some leading business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Associated General Contractors of America, have withdrawn support for the infrastructure spending bill, though Mr. Obama cited the Chamber as a supporter in his remarks. The House has declined to take up Mr. Obama\u2019s jobs package, while Senate Democrats could not muster the 60 votes needed to block a Republican filibuster against either the full $447 billion package or a $35 billion piece providing state aid, mostly for teachers\u2019 pay. With White House support, Senate Democrats have broken the measure into its main parts to force Republicans to take a series of tough votes on proposals, each of which has broad public support, according to polls. \u201cThe American people are with me with this,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s time for folks running around spending all their time talking about what\u2019s wrong with America to spend some time rolling up their sleeves to help us make it right. There\u2019s nothing wrong in this country that we can\u2019t fix.\u201d The outcome in the Senate on the infrastructure spending provision, however, is not expected to be any different from the previous two votes. Mr. Obama\u2019s transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, a former Republican congressman from Illinois, appeared with him at the Key Bridge and then went to the Capitol to meet with lawmakers. In response to Mr. Obama, House Republicans said the Democratic-controlled Senate should take up some 16 House-passed measures; most would attack federal regulations or spending and would have long-term impact, analysts say, but they would not spur job creation in the coming year or two. Mr. Boehner facetiously said that Mr. Obama, as a former Democratic senator, could help: \u201cI\u2019m sure he has great influence over there in terms of getting them to take up these bills that really will help put the American people back to work.\u201d",

Flynn,\u201d Trump told reporters before leaving for a trip to Utah, saying that Flynn\u2019s life has been \u201cruined.\u201d Trump then pivoted to Clinton, apparently referring to the FBI\u2019s investigation into her use of a private email server. \u201cHillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI, and nothing happened to her.

Flynn lied, and it\u2019s like, it ruined his life. It\u2019s very unfair.\u201d The president this morning says 'I feel badly for General Flynn.' #MorningJoe pic.twitter.com/tBp5aXWhBj \u2014 Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) December 4, 2017 Flynn pleaded guilty on Friday for lying to the FBI in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia, becoming the first former administration official to face charges in the probe. Trump and the White House have long claimed that the investigations into the campaign have nothing to do with Trump himself. Flynn\u2019s indictment, however, makes it increasingly difficult for the president to distance himself. Flynn stepped down in February, saying that he had misled the transition team, including then Vice President-elect Mike Pence, about the extent of his contacts with Russian officials, which included discussing sanctions and the creation of a backchannel with the Kremlin. Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, now claim that the president already knew about Flynn lying to the FBI, renewing questions of whether Trump obstructed justice in the investigation. In May, Trump told NBC\u2019s Lester Holt that he fired then-FBI Director James Comey with \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d in mind. The following month, Comey testified before the Senate that Trump had requested that Comey put an end to the agency\u2019s investigation into Flynn. In an interview with Axios published Monday, Dowd brought out a new defense: Trump isn\u2019t guilty of obstructing justice because he is the president. The \u201cPresident cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under [the Constitution\u2019s Article II] and has every right to express his view of any case,\u201d Dowd said.",

In a speech from beneath the D.C. area's Key Bridge, Obama told spectators that Congress had time to bring up votes on aspects of the American Jobs Act, but were instead dealing with more frivolous legislation. \"And if Congress tells you they don't have time, they've got time to do it,\" Obama said. \"In the House of Representatives, what have you guys been doing, John?\" Obama continued, calling out Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio). \"You've been debating a commemorative coin for baseball. You've had legislation reaffirming that 'In God We Trust' is our motto. That's not putting people back to work. I trust in God, but God wants to see us help ourselves by putting people back to work.\" On Wednesday, the House voted 396-9 on a bill that reaffirmed the motto and encouraged its display in all public schools and government buildings. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Randy Forbes (R-Va.) had argued that some people, including Obama, needed to be reminded of the motto. \"Almost a year ago, the president in making a speech across the world said that our national motto was 'E pluribus unum,'\" Forbes said. \"When the [U.S. Capitol] Visitor Center was opened ... they did not have the national motto in there. In fact, they inscribed in the stones that our national motto was 'E pluribus unum.'\" In a speech in Jakarta last year, Obama remarked that the American \"motto is E pluribus unum -- out of many, one.\" Officially, this wasn't correct. Minnesota congresswoman and now-GOP presidential candidate Michele Bachmann and other members of the Congressional Prayer Caucus piled on weeks later, penning a letter to Obama chastising him for his alleged failure to the use the word \"God\" and \"Creator\" more in his public speeches, especially abroad.",

If the Republicans are being sincere, they would help us pass this long overdue bill to help the first responders whose health and livelihoods have been devastated because of their bravery on 911, rather than continuing to block this much-needed legislation.\" Combined, Obama's clarification and Reid's opposition represent a double dose of bad news for progressives and even Republicans who believed that a strong case could be made in favor of Cordoba House. If anything, it's clearer now than it was last week (when Democrats were mostly silent on the matter) how deeply the party just wants this entire issue to go away.

For that reason alone, he should step down. If Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words 'Radical Islam' she should get out of this race for the Presidency,\" Trump said in a statement released by his campaign. \"If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore. Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen \u2013 and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct anymore,\" the statement continued. In their remarks on Sunday, both Obama and Clinton referred to the shooting as an \u201cact of terror\" and an \"act of hate.\" Obama last year explained that he refuses to describe the self-proclaimed Islamic State and al Qaeda as groups fueled by \u201cradical Islam\u201d because the term grants them a religious legitimacy they don\u2019t deserve. Trump noted in his statement that the gunman, Omar Mateen, was \"the son of an immigrant from Afghanistan who openly published his support for the Afghanistani Taliban and even tried to run for President of Afghanistan.\" According to the Washington Post, Seddique Mateen expressed gratitude toward the Afghan Taliban in videos posted online. His son had reportedly pledged allegiance to ISIS before executing the attack, though officials say there is no evidence he had direct ties to the group. Trump also criticized Clinton, his presumptive Democratic challenger, for wanting to \"dramatically increase admissions\" of Syrian refugees into the United States. \"We need to protect all Americans, of all backgrounds and all beliefs, from Radical Islamic Terrorism - which has no place in an open and tolerant society,\" Trump said. \"Radical Islam advocates hate for women, gays, Jews, Christians and all Americans. I am going to be a President for all Americans, and I am going to protect and defend all Americans.\" In a follow-up tweet posted later Sunday, Trump reiterated his call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States -- even though the Orlando gunman was an American citizen, born in New York.

Mr. Trump, the president\u2019s son, in recent weeks handed over Twitter messages he exchanged with WikiLeaks to several congressional committees investigating Russia\u2019s attempts to disrupt the election, according to the officials. In September, Mr. Trump acknowledged in a closed-door interview with the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had corresponded with the group during the campaign, the officials said. The correspondence, which began weeks before the Nov. 8, 2016, election and continued through much of this year, is the second time it has been publicly revealed that Mr. Trump communicated with people and organizations with ties to the Russian government who were trying to undermine the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. In July, The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump met with Russians in June 2016 who said they had damaging information on Mrs. Clinton, and that the information was part of the Russian government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump on Monday night releasedseveralscreen shots of his messages with WikiLeaks. His lawyer, Alan S. Futerfas, said the documents were \u201cselectively leaked\u201d among the thousands that have been turned over to congressional investigators. \u201cWe can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum,\u201d Mr. Futerfas said in a statement. By publishing thousands of hacked emails, American intelligence agencies believe WikiLeaks was acting as a conduit for Russian operatives. The Twitter messages were first reported by The Atlantic, which published copies of the correspondence. \u201cHiya, it\u2019d be great if you guys could comment on/push this story,\u201d WikiLeaks said in a message to Mr. Trump on Oct. 3, 2016, that included a quote from Mrs. Clinton in which she said she wanted to \u201cjust drone\u201d Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder. \u201cAlready did that earlier today,\u201d Mr. Trump said in response. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what she can get away with.\u201d In a message a week later, WikiLeaks asked Mr. Trump to have his father tweet a link to a site where users could search through hacked emails from Democrats. \u201cThere\u2019s many great stories the press are missing and we\u2019re sure some of your follows will find it,\u201d WikiLeaks said, adding that the group had just released more emails stolen from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta. Mr. Trump did not respond. Fifteen minutes later, however, his father tweeted: \u201cVery little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system!\u201d Mr. Assange said on Twitter that he could not confirm whether the group had corresponded with Mr. Trump. \u201cWikiLeaks loves its pending publications and ignores those who ask for details,\u201d Mr. Assange said, adding that thousands of people had asked the group about the emails it had published. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the messages, if real, are \u201cone more example of Russians, Russian agents \u2014 in this case WikiLeaks \u2014 reaching out to senior officials in the Trump Organization or Trump campaign.\u201d The last message Mr. Trump received from WikiLeaks was in July, shortly after The Times reported that he had corresponded with the Russians promising \u201cdirt\u201d on Mrs. Clinton. \u201cHi Don. Sorry to hear about your problems,\u201d WikiLeaks said. \u201cWe have an idea that may help a little. We are VERY interested in confidentially obtaining and publishing a copy of the email(s) cited in the New York Times today.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Mr. Trump released the emails himself.",

Those markets house some of the state\u2019s largest Jewish communities. The pollster for Secure America Now is John McLaughlin, who has worked with Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party.\u201d The ad features Netanyahu laying out Israel\u2019s security concerns about Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which Republicans have used to knock President Barack Obama\u2019s sometimes frosty relationship with the Israeli prime minister.  Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has repeatedly targeted the Obama administration for not taking a firm enough stance against Iran, claiming on many occasions that the president has \u201cthrown Israel under a bus.\u201d The GOP also has attacked the president for declining an opportunity to meet with Netanyahu at the United Nations General Assembly later this month in an effort to paint the current White House as dismissive of Israel and its concerns. But Netanyahu pushed back against these criticisms in two separate interviews on Sunday, first telling CNN, \u201cI know that people are trying to draw me into the American election. I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d He also rejected reports that Obama refused his request for a meeting, pinning the circumstances on a scheduling conflict, as has the White House when pressed on the subject. \u201cPresident Obama has said that he\u2019s determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons and I appreciate that and I respect that,\u201d Netanyahu said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d When asked if Obama had thrown Israel under a bus, Netanyahu responded, \u201cThere is no bus.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first ad Secure America Now has run against Obama, even though on its website the organization describes itself as representing all political ideologies.

        "body": " The resurgent controversy over the Obama administration's initial story-line on the Benghazi attack underscores State Department concerns about the leadership's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents. Draft \"talking points\" obtained by The Weekly Standard and ABC News depicted efforts by State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in the days after the attack to strip out references to prior attacks in Benghazi. According to the excerpts, she argued that the administration should not give Congress ammunition to \"beat up\" on her department. During a press conference Monday, President Obama even acknowledged that the country now knows that \"clearly (the staff in Benghazi) were not in a position where they were adequately protected.\" A review of now-public State Department records as well as a classified State Department cable, first reviewed and reported by Fox News, shows a steady stream of documented warnings to Washington from intelligence and State security officials on the ground in Libya that the Islamist threat was severe and growing. One of the most significant warnings was an August 2012 State Department classified cable, which has not been made public, that summarized an emergency meeting in Benghazi where the CIA briefed on the significant threat of terrorist activity. The cable, sent under Ambassador Chris Stevens' signature and marked SECRET, warned the office of Secretary of State Clinton that the CIA advised \"ten Islamist militias and AQ training camps (were) within Benghazi.\" The cable also warned that the 17 February Brigade, the group charged with protecting the consulate, appeared to be compromised. It said \"requests to provide a daily police presence have gone unanswered,\" adding there was also a \"lack of host nation security support to the US mission.\" In addition to identifying the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi, the groups ultimately blamed for the assault, a key section of the cable, which remains classified, seemed to foreshadow the attack itself. \"RSO (Regional Security Officer) expressed concerns with the ability to defend Post in the event of a coordinated attack due to limited manpower, security measures, weapons capabilities, host nation support, and the overall size of the compound,\" it said. During congressional hearings in January, Clinton was asked whether she had seen the cable by Republican Rep. Michael McCaul. Clinton said she had no knowledge of the warning which former diplomatic security agents have told Fox News amounted to a \"cry for help.\" \"Congressman, that cable did not come to my attention,\" Clinton testified before the House Foreign Affairs committee. \"I have made it very clear that the security cable did not come to my attention or above the assistant secretary level where the ARB (Accountability Review Board) placed responsibility where, as I think, Ambassador Pickering said the rubber hit the road.\" In February, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham followed up on the classified cable. After the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed he knew about the cable which summarized the August emergency meeting in Benghazi, Graham questioned why the military was read in when Clinton apparently was not. Gen. Martin Dempsey responded: \"Well, I don't know that she didn't know about the cable.\" Graham said: \"She said she didn't. Are you stunned that she didn't?\" Dempsey said: \"I would call myself surprised that she didn't.\" In addition to attacks in Benghazi on the British ambassador -- which forced the temporary closure of the U.K. operation -- the International Red Cross and United Nations, in the summer of 2012 the group Ansar al-Sharia was so well-established it held an annual conference in Benghazi to promote Islamic law. Records released by the House oversight committee, including a report from the regional security officer, also documented more than 200 cases of violence in Libya in the year leading up to the attack, specifically between June 2011 and July 2012. Another security review, on June 25, 2012, reported a spike in violence with \"foreigners also increasingly targeted.\" While much has been made of the State Department's failure to respond to repeated security requests for extra help, a former diplomatic security agent and 20-year veteran of the department, who reviewed the publicly available documents on the condition of anonymity, told Fox News the multiple warnings present a compelling argument that State Department leadership was negligent. The State Department, in a document put out last week, noted that while an internal review found certain senior officials \"demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability\" in response to security concerns, there was no specific finding of misconduct.",

Now under the protection of her lawyers and the Fifth Amendment, Lois Lerner is facing a maelstrom of controversy. Members of Congress are calling her evasive, and question why she didn't reveal the program sooner -- plus her history at the Federal Elections Commission is coming under scrutiny. Lerner touched off the public controversy when, at an American Bar Association conference earlier this month, she apologized for the IRS' practice of targeting conservative organizations for additional scrutiny. It was the first time the agency acknowledged the practice. \"They used names like Tea Party or patriots ... and they selected cases simply because the application had those names in the title,\" she admitted. She said she hadn't revealed the information sooner, because she was never asked. But just two days before the ABA conference, Lerner was specifically asked about the investigation. Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., asked her if she could \"comment briefly on the status on the IRS investigation into these political not-for-profits.\" She said: \"Well there's a questionnaire that began this discussion and there's also a questionnaire out there that is seeking info from 501 c3,4,5 organizations.\" Crowley later called her answer evasive. \"The bottom line is you cannot lie to Congress, and you cannot be evasive, you cannot try to mislead Congress,\" he said. In the 1990's, Lerner also served as chief of enforcement at the Federal Elections Commission. Under her direction, the FEC undertook the largest enforcement action in its history -- suing the Christian Coalition for violating campaign laws. The Christian Coalition won, but in one deposition, FEC lawyers asked a defendant if televangelist Pat Robertson prayed for him. James Bopp, the Christian Coalition's lawyer, said he was \"shocked and appalled\" by that. \"Both political activity and religious activity are specifically protected by the First Amendment,\" he said. When Bopp learned years later that Lerner had been promoted to an IRS position, he became concerned. \"She was in effect being promoted for what she had done at the Federal Election Commission and now was going to be expected ... to replicate that at the IRS and now we know that's exactly what happened,\" he said. Lerner is represented by lawyer William W. Taylor, who is noted for winning a dismissal of all charges against former IMF director Dominique Strauss-Kahn in a high-profile sexual assault case. Lerner said at Wednesday's hearing that she had done nothing wrong. \"I have not done anything wrong,\" she said. \"I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.\"",

        "body": " New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm's attorney confirmed late Friday that federal prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against the congressman. The decision follows a two-year FBI investigation into various aspects of Grimm's business and campaign history. \"We are disappointed by the government's decision, but hardly surprised,\" said the statement from Grimm's attorney, William McGinley. \"From the beginning, the government has pursued a politically driven vendetta against Congressman Grimm and not an independent search for the truth.\" The statement said Grimm \"asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing\" and \"will be vindicated.\" \"Until then, he will continue to serve his constituents with the same dedication and tenacity that has characterized his lifetime of public service as a Member of Congress, Marine Corps combat veteran, and decorated FBI Special Agent,\" the statement said. The House Ethics Committee announced in November that Grimm was under investigation for possible campaign finance violations. That committee said it would defer its inquiry because of a separate Department of Justice investigation. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn said he could not confirm, deny or comment on the case. Grimm made headlines in January after confronting a New York City cable news station reporter who tried to question him about a long-running FBI investigation into campaign finance on a balcony in the Capitol. After reporter Michael Scotto finished his report, Grimm stormed back, leaned into him and said, \"Let me be clear to you. If you ever do that to me again, I'll throw you off this (expletive) balcony.\" Scotto, who was asking about fundraising during Grimm's first campaign, protested, saying he was asking \"a valid question.\" During that race, Grimm has acknowledged receiving $250,000 to $300,000 in contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto. Some members of Pinto's congregation subsequently said they made tens of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions, including gifts passed through straw donors. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, and the FBI hasn't accused him of any wrongdoing. The Israeli businessman who had served as Grimm's liaison to Pinto's followers, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty in August to an immigration fraud charge. Three days after that guilty plea, the FBI filed a sealed criminal complaint accusing a Houston woman who had been romantically involved with Grimm of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions. In that case, made public this month, the woman was accused of funneling at least $10,000 to Grimm's campaign by passing them through friends who agreed to have the donations listed under their names. A spokesman in Grimm's Washington office, Nick Iacono, did not immediately return emails or a telephone message seeking comment Friday.",

Chris Christie\u2019s re-election campaign and to the state Republican Party as part of a preliminary inquiry into accusations that aides to Mr. Christie shut down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge as political retribution, the lawyer for the campaign and the party said Thursday. A person briefed on the matter said the prosecutors had also issued subpoenas to some of the 20 people and entities \u2014 including potential witnesses and people who have come under scrutiny in the inquiry \u2014 that received subpoenas last week from a New Jersey legislative committee whose investigation largely parallels the federal one. \u201cWe can confirm that the Christie for Governor re-election campaign and the New Jersey Republican State Committee received subpoenas for documents from the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, in addition to the subpoena the campaign previously received from the state legislative committee,\u201d the lawyer, Mark D. Sheridan, said in an email. Mr. Sheridan is representing the campaign along with Robert D. Luskin; both men are partners at Patton Boggs. \u201cThe campaign and the state party intend to cooperate with the U.S. attorney\u2019s office and the state legislative committee and will respond to the subpoenas accordingly,\u201d Mr. Sheridan said. According to the person briefed on the matter, the subpoenas, issued by prosecutors in the office of the United States attorney for New Jersey, Paul J. Fishman, seek a broad range of records relating to the lane closings: emails, text messages, other correspondence and memorandums, calendar entries, spreadsheets, voice mail messages. They also specifically seek records relating to three close aides to Mr. Christie who resigned or were fired when their roles in the lane closings were revealed. They were the governor\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, and Bill Baroni and David Wildstein, two senior officials and allies of Mr. Christie at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and prosecutors from Mr. Fishman\u2019s office have also undertaken what appears to be an unrelated inquiry. On Saturday, the mayor of Hoboken, Dawn Zimmer, said Mr. Christie\u2019s lieutenant governor and another senior administration official had threatened in May to withhold federal recovery aid for Hurricane Sandy unless she supported a development favored by the Christie administration. On Sunday, Ms. Zimmer issued a statement saying prosecutors in Mr. Fishman\u2019s office had interviewed her about her accusation. The lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, emphatically denied the allegations on Monday. Ms. Zimmer\u2019s account, however, was supported in some measure by two of the mayor\u2019s aides, who were interviewed by F.B.I. agents and told them that Ms. Zimmer had recounted the threat to them around the time she said it occurred, two people briefed on the matter have said. A Hoboken city councilman, David Mello, also said that Ms. Zimmer told him several months later about the encounter with Ms. Guadagno. The bridge inquiry being conducted by Mr. Fishman\u2019s office was confirmed this month. The office said at the time that it would seek to determine whether any federal laws had been broken. The subpoenas issued this week show that prosecutors have begun taking the necessary steps to answer that question. A spokeswoman for Mr. Fishman\u2019s office, Rebekah Carmichael, said Thursday afternoon that she could neither confirm nor deny whether any specific investigative steps had been taken. She has declined to comment on Ms. Zimmer\u2019s allegation. Despite the inquiries, Mr. Christie seemed to be trying to conduct business as usual. The Republican Governors Association announced on Thursday that he would make fund-raising trips to Illinois, Texas, Massachusetts, Georgia, Connecticut and Utah in the coming months.",

A grand jury in San Diego indicted the Hunters on charges of filing false campaign finance records, saying the couple misused more than $250,000 after a two-year investigation. The Justice Department said the pair used political money to pay for their children\u2019s tuition and spent thousands of dollars at shopping malls, Washington restaurants and surf shops, among other expenditures. The indictment includes details accusing the Hunters of making efforts to hide their personal expenses, including labeling fees for dental work as a donation to a charity called \u201cSmiles for Life\u201d and tickets to see Riverdance as a fundraising event for \u201cRepublican women.\u201d Hunter, 41, is a five-term congressman representing San Diego County who served for three tours in Afghanistan and Iraq as a Marine. His family has been a household name in California politics for decades, and his father, also named Duncan Hunter, served in the U.S. House for nearly 30 years until handing the reins to his son. Hunter had blamed his wife, who acted as a campaign manager, for many of the improper charges, saying she controlled the campaign\u2019s credit card, and in February he feigned ignorance in an interview with Politico, saying: \u201cNah, I know the rules.\u201d \u201cAnd if I did\u201d spend campaign funds improperly, he said, \u201cit was an accident and I paid it back.\u201d He repaid his campaign more than $60,000 earlier this year for improper expenses dating back to 2015, but the FBI began investigation additional charges dating back as far as 2009, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. \u201cThe goal of the conspiracy was for Duncan Hunter and Margaret Hunter to enrich themselves, and others at their direction, by converting campaign funds for their own personal benefit and enjoyment,\u201d the 47-page indictment says. \u201cThe Hunters knew that many of their desired purchases could be made only by using campaign funds, since they did not otherwise have sufficient personal funds to pay for their purchases.\u201d In a speech earlier this month, Hunter echoed President Donald Trump and castigated the Justice Department, accusing the agency of being \u201ccorrupt, answerable to no one\u201d and said it \u201cuses the law to extort the American people and effect political change.\u201d \u201cI call on this Congress to root out all the corrupt lawyers and bureaucrats in the DOJ and the FBI so the greatest president of my generation can do the work that the American people duly elected him to do,\u201d Hunter said. The lawmaker is running for re-election in November against Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar. When HuffPost asked Hunter how his campaign was going at the end of July, just before House lawmakers left for the August break, Hunter said things were good. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a big wave right now,\u201d Hunter said, referring to a wave of Democratic gains. He said polling had him safely above his opponent \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re looking good\u201d \u2014 and he indicated he wasn\u2019t really afraid of losing. \u201cThe Republicans left in California are pretty well-liked by their constituents,\u201d he said.",

        "body": " Obama Gun Control Proposals Unveiled, Marking Biggest Legislative Effort In A Generation WASHINGTON -- In a bold and potentially historic attempt to stem the increase in mass gun violence, President Barack Obama unveiled on Wednesday the most sweeping effort at gun control policy reform in a generation. \"This is our first task as a society: keeping our children safe. This is how we will be judged,\" Obama said. \u201cWe can\u2019t put this off any longer.\" The proposal, which comes at the end of a month-long review process spearheaded by Vice President Joe Biden, is broken down into four key subsections: law enforcement, the availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety and mental health. In an effort to touch on all four of those elements, the president recommended requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales; reinstating the assault weapons ban; restoring a 10-round limit on ammunition magazines; eliminating armor-piercing bullets; providing mental health services in schools; allocating funds to hire more police officers; and instituting a federal gun trafficking statute, among other policies. The cost of the package, senior officials estimated, would be roughly $500 million, some of which could come from already budgeted funds. Because these recommendations require congressional approval, the administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions that will be taken immediately. Those actions include requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system; providing law enforcement officials, first responders and school officials with better training for active shooting situations; directing the Centers for Disease Control to research the causes and prevention of gun violence; and many more. \"I intend to use whatever weight this office holds to make them a reality,\" said the president, speaking about his full set of recommendations. \"If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try.\" The approach is so sweeping that what would have otherwise been a headline-grabbing announcement received second billing. The president on Wednesday will nominate Byron Todd Jones, the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to take over the post permanently. In total, the proposal goes beyond what most gun control advocates were hoping for at the start of Biden's review process, during which he held 22 different meetings with 229 different organizations and 31 elected officials. \"This is a monumental moment. It's a long time coming and we're thrilled the president's putting the full weight of his office behind this,\" said Josh Horowitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. \"We're ready to push this thing through.\" But putting together ideas is the easy part. Selling them on the Hill will take a bit of legislative craft. Seasoned political observers have questioned whether it makes more sense to break the package into separate bills or push for one comprehensive proposal. A senior administration official said that the president's proposal shouldn't be considered finalized legislative language, but rather a series of recommendations for Congress to consider. The president would be working with lawmakers to move the process forward, the official added, and would be trying to build up public opinion as well. \"I will put everything I've got into this and so will Joe [Biden]. But I tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it,\" said Obama. \"We are going to need voices in those areas and congressional districts where the tradition of gun ownership is strong.\" \"It can't just be the usual suspects,\" he continued. \"This will not happen unless the American people demand it.\" The gun-rights lobby has already signaled that it will try to block the administration's effort. A spokesman for the National Rifle Association did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the president's proposal. But the organization has already harshly criticized the Obama administration for overreach. \"It is unfortunate that this administration continues to insist on pushing failed solutions to our nation's most pressing problems,\" the NRA said after meeting with Biden last week. \"We will not allow law-abiding gun owners to be blamed for the acts of criminals and madmen.\" The group continued its offensive this week, launching an advertising campaign attacking Obama as an \"elitist hypocrite\" for opposing the NRA's widely-criticized proposal, made after the Newtown, Conn. shooting, to place armed guards in all of the nation's schools. But that attack appeared a bit premature. As part of its policy recommendations, the White House called on Congress to act on an old administration proposal to spend $4 billion to keep 15,000 cops on the streets. In addition, the president is proposing a new initiative that would incentivize police departments to hire more school resource officers and encourage schools to hire more mental health professionals. The president's plan also calls on Congress to allocate resources to help schools, other educational institutions and houses of worship develop emergency management plans. The White House proposals, even officials there admit, are not a cure-all for mass shootings. Among the suggested recommendations on the gun-policy front, only the ban on high-capacity magazines could have had a tangible impact on the shooting in Newtown, and it's unclear what, exactly, the effect would have been. Moreover, the administration is pointedly not going after those weapons and ammunition magazines that are currently and lawfully owned. The proposal would instead affect the future production and sale of military-style weapons or high-capacity magazines. \"We are not going to go after existing stock of weapons or magazines,\" said a senior administration official. \"We are going to limit it to the manufacturing of assault weapons and clips going forward.\" The White House nevertheless insists that its package of proposals has teeth. It would provide law enforcement with the mechanisms needed to go after the illegal transfer of weapons and help prevent those weapons from falling into the wrong hands. It would also stem the use of military-style weapons -- the White House says its proposal would improve on the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, which was riddled with loopholes -- and give schools and communities resources to address violence when it occurs. The question, in some respects, is not what's missing from the set of ideas, but what took the administration so long to get to this point. \"It is not as though we had this whole policy paper sitting on the shelf somewhere,\" said a senior administration official. \"[We worked] 24/7 for the past month. And we met with a lot of groups and we learned a lot of ideas that came as a result of this process. We tried to be as comprehensive as possible. We are hoping that as the process goes on and as the debate goes on, we might come up with some other ideas.\"",

        "body": " WASHINGTON - And on the second day of Republican rule, the House read the Constitution. Those wondering whether the reading would be dramatic found out on Thursday as volunteers gave voice to the seven articles and 27 amendments that make up the nation\u2019s governing document. Republicans have made strict adherence to the Constitution a key tenet of their effort to reduce the size of the federal government. The House GOP will reportedly make it a requirement that all new bills put forth in the legislative body include \u201ca statement by the lawmaker who wrote it citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation.\u201d The Washington Post reported last week that reading the founding document in full appears to be a first in the chamber\u2019s 221-year history: \u201cCall it the tea party-ization of Congress. ... These are two standout changes on a long list of new rules Republicans will institute in the House when they assume the majority on Jan. 5. After handing out pocket-size Constitutions at rallies, after studying the document article by article and after demanding that Washington return to its founding principles, tea party activists have something new to applaud. A pillar of their grass-roots movement will become a staple in the bureaucracy that governs Congress.\u201d Politics Daily recently reported: \u201cBeyond its symbolic power, however, it is unclear what impact the new rule will have upon the nation. Under axiomatic legal precedent, virtually all congressional action is presumed valid anyway, at least initially. Moreover, by taking their oaths of office, lawmakers swear to abide by the Constitution, and virtually all legislation is vetted for constitutional support on some level by government lawyers before it makes it to committee or to the floor of the House. It is also quite obvious, from 223 years of legal and political debate on the topic, that the text of the Constitution itself, including those portions that deal with legislative power, is susceptible to many different (and often evolving) views and interpretations, a practical reality that would likely render most \u201cConstitutional Authority Statements\u201d controversial and contentious.\u201d According to Peter Keating at Vanity Fair, $1.1 million is the estimated cost of GOP plans to read the document on the House floor.  \u201cThe amount I get is nearly $1.1 million. $1,071,872.87, to be exact, though of course this is more back-of-the-envelope than exact. When one chamber of Congress is in session but not working, we the people still have to pay for members\u2019 salaries and expenses, and for their police protection, and for keeping their lights and phones and coffee machines on.\u201d \u201cWe always hear members of Congress talking about swearing an oath to represent their constituents, when in reality the only oath we take is to the Constitution,\u201d explained newly-minted Speaker John Boehner to the Post. \u201cOn November 2nd, voters called for an end to reckless spending and a renewed commitment to the Constitution,\u201d said Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), who has emerged a prominent voice of the Tea Party movement, to the Post. \u201cThese new rules show that Republicans are serious about respecting the Constitution.\u201d Also on Thursday, the House is to take up its first spending cut measure, a proposed 5 percent trim in the budgets of leadership, rank-and-file member and committee offices.

        "body": " At a ceremony honoring veterans and senior citizens who sent presents to soldiers overseas, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut rose and spoke of an earlier time in his life. \u201cWe have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said to the group gathered in Norwalk in March 2008. \u201cAnd you exemplify it. Whatever we think about the war, whatever we call it \u2014 Afghanistan or Iraq \u2014 we owe our military men and women unconditional support.\u201d There was one problem: Mr. Blumenthal, a Democrat now running for the United States Senate, never served in Vietnam. He obtained at least five military deferments from 1965 to 1970 and took repeated steps that enabled him to avoid going to war, according to records. The deferments allowed Mr. Blumenthal to complete his studies at Harvard; pursue a graduate fellowship in England; serve as a special assistant to The Washington Post\u2019s publisher, Katharine Graham; and ultimately take a job in the Nixon White House. In 1970, with his last deferment in jeopardy, he landed a coveted spot in the Marine Reserve, which virtually guaranteed that he would not be sent to Vietnam. He joined a unit in Washington that conducted drills and other exercises and focused on local projects, like fixing a campground and organizing a Toys for Tots drive. Many politicians have faced questions over their decisions during the Vietnam War, and Mr. Blumenthal, who is seeking the seat being vacated by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, is not alone in staying out of the war. But what is striking about Mr. Blumenthal\u2019s record is the contrast between the many steps he took that allowed him to avoid Vietnam, and the misleading way he often speaks about that period of his life now, especially when he is speaking at veterans\u2019 ceremonies or other patriotic events. Sometimes his remarks have been plainly untrue, as in his speech to the group in Norwalk. At other times, he has used more ambiguous language, but the impression left on audiences can be similar. In an interview on Monday, the attorney general said that he had misspoken about his service during the Norwalk event and might have misspoken on other occasions. \u201cMy intention has always been to be completely clear and accurate and straightforward, out of respect to the veterans who served in Vietnam,\u201d he said. But an examination of his remarks at the ceremonies shows that he does not volunteer that his service never took him overseas. And he describes the hostile reaction directed at veterans coming back from Vietnam, intimating that he was among them. In 2003, he addressed a rally in Bridgeport, where about 100 military families gathered to express support for American troops overseas. \u201cWhen we returned, we saw nothing like this,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said. \u201cLet us do better by this generation of men and women.\u201d At a 2008 ceremony in front of the Veterans War Memorial Building in Shelton, he praised the audience for paying tribute to troops fighting abroad, noting that America had not always done so. \u201cI served during the Vietnam era,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember the taunts, the insults, sometimes even physical abuse.\u201d Mr. Blumenthal, 64, is known as a brilliant lawyer who likes to argue cases in court and uses language with power and precision. He is also savvy about the news media and attentive to how he is portrayed in the press. But the way he speaks about his military service has led to confusion and frequent mischaracterizations of his biography in his home state newspapers. In at least eight newspaper articles published in Connecticut from 2003 to 2009, he is described as having served in Vietnam. The New Haven Register on July 20, 2006, described him as \u201ca veteran of the Vietnam War,\u201d and on April 6, 2007, said that the attorney general had \u201cserved in the Marines in Vietnam.\u201d On May 26, 2009, The Connecticut Post, a Bridgeport newspaper that is the state\u2019s third-largest daily, described Mr. Blumenthal as \u201ca Vietnam veteran.\u201d The Shelton Weekly reported on May 23, 2008, that Mr. Blumenthal \u201cwas met with applause when he spoke about his experience as a Marine sergeant in Vietnam.\u201d And the idea that he served in Vietnam has become such an accepted part of his public biography that when a national outlet, Slate magazine, produced a profile of Mr. Blumenthal in 2000, it said he had \u201cenlisted in the Marines rather than duck the Vietnam draft.\u201d It does not appear that Mr. Blumenthal ever sought to correct those mistakes. In the interview, he said he was not certain whether he had seen the stories or whether any steps had been taken to point out the inaccuracies. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we tried to do so or not,\u201d he said. He added that he \u201ccan\u2019t possibly know what is reported in all\u201d the articles that are written about him, given the large number of appearances he makes at military-style events. He said he had tried to stick to a consistent way of describing his military experience: that he served as a member of the United State Marine Corps Reserve during the Vietnam era. Asked about the Bridgeport rally, when he told the crowd, \u201cWhen we returned, we saw nothing like this,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said he did not recall the event.",

Politico reported over the weekend that many of his supporters as well as other GOP operatives believe that a Steele run was looking increasingly doubtful, due in part to the fact that he \"has built no known reelection team or structure, making the prospect of a campaign unlikely in the face of competition that grows fiercer by the day.\" Meanwhile, multiple sources tell Fox News that they believe Steele will drop out of the race. And while many predict that Steele will call it quits after his current term, his increasing seclusion and detachment from other Republican advisers has made his forthcoming decision difficult to ascertain. At least one GOP insider who had direct contact with Steele told the Washington Post that the chairman would indeed be seeking another term atop the RNC. Hotline On Call says the nature of the decision is a \"closely guarded secret\" and reports that \"even his top advisors, both inside and outside the committee, say they don't know which direction he will take.\" Steele's gaffe-prone tenure at the helm of the RNC has aided the creation of a significant bloc of GOPers who are intent on seeing his departure next month. While some, such as black conservative group BOND Action, have directly announced their intentions to work toward insuring Steele's termination at the committee, other Republicans have simply lined up behind his growing list of challengers. Maria Cino, a former Bush official who recently received key backing from former RNC Chairman Ed Gillespie and former Vice President Dick Cheney, became the latest official contender this weekend. Wisconsin GOP Chairman Reince Preibus, recently resigned RNC political director Gentry Collins, former U.S. ambassador Ann Wagner and former Michigan GOP chairman Saul Anuzis also round out the list. Politico also reports that former Senator Norm Coleman could enter the race if Steele decides not to run.",

Social media companies, facing pressure from lawmakers and users over their role in the rise of misinformation and partisan division, have promised to step up their enforcement practices.  They have banned a number of pages and accounts in recent weeks for being involved in activity intended to disrupt the midterm elections, and almost all of the major platforms removed content from Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist, this month over what they called hateful and violent speech. After the content from Mr. Jones and his website, Infowars, was removed, he issued a plea to Mr. Trump to block the companies\u2019 actions and \u201ccome out before the midterms and make the censorship the big issue.\u201d In the same video appeal, Mr. Jones urged Mr. Trump to \u201cpoint out that the communist Chinese have penetrated and infiltrated\u201d the American election system and are \u201cway, way worse than the Russians.\u201d Minutes after his tweets on Saturday morning about social media, the president \u2014 who has long had an affinity for conspiracy theories \u2014 appeared to do just that. \u201cAll of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction, China,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.  \u201cBut in the end, if we are smart, tough and well prepared, we will get along with everyone! Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets on Saturday, sent from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., were not the first time he has accused social media companies of discriminating against Republicans.  Last month, he joined with prominent conservatives who have seized on the heightened enforcement of guidelines and the concept of shadow banning on Twitter \u2014 making social media posts invisible to everyone except the posters themselves \u2014 as proof of biased attacks on their views. Twitter has said that it does not shadow ban users, although it has struggled to define what its policies against hate speech are.  In the case of Mr. Jones, it did not initially join the other major platforms in removing his content, and has since taken relatively minor steps against him. Mr. Jones has had his posts and videos on his personal account and on Infowars severely restricted or removed by Apple, Facebook, Google and Spotify.  Twitter, which initially said Mr. Jones and Infowars had not violated its policies, later suspended the two accounts for a week for violating rules against inciting violence. In his tweets on Saturday, Mr. Trump urged social media companies to \u201clet everybody participate, good & bad,\u201d saying that while networks like CNN and MSNBC might be \u201cfake news,\u201d he does not \u201cask that their sick behavior be removed.\u201d Yet Mr. Trump has waged relentless attacks on news coverage that he does not like, and has long expressed hostility toward traditional press freedoms.  He has vowed to \u201copen up\u201d the nation\u2019s libel laws, even though those statutes are in fact state, not federal, laws. ",

In a series of tweets, Trump Jr. produced \u201cthe entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak. How ironic!\u201d The Atlantic first reported on Monday that Trump Jr. received a private message from the WikiLeaks Twitter account on September 20, 2016 \u2014 a message shown in the tweets produced by the president\u2019s son. \u201cA PAC run anti-Trump site putintrump.org is about to launch,\u201d WikiLeaks wrote. \u201cThe PAC is a recycled pro-Iraq war PAC. We have guessed the password. It is \u2018putintrump.\u2019 See \u2018About\u2019 for who is behind it. Any comments?\u201d Trump Jr. replied, \u201cOff the record I don\u2019t know who that is, but I\u2019ll ask around. Thanks.\u201d In a separate October 2016 exchange, WikiLeaks urged Trump Jr. to \u201ccomment on/push this story\u201d about then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wanting to \u201cjust drone\u201d Julian Assange, the Wikileaks founder. \u201cAlready did that earlier today,\u201d Trump Jr. later replied. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what she can get away with.\u201d The messages obtained by The Atlantic were turned over to investigators by Trump Jr.\u2019s attorneys. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence had access to the documents, a source told Fox News. \u201cOver the last several months, we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents in response to their requests,\u201d Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Trump Jr., said in a statement. \u201cPutting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents, provided to Congress under promises of confidentiality, have been selectively leaked, we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum.\u201d According to the report, the messages are part of a long correspondence between WikiLeaks and Trump Jr., though Trump Jr. seemed to ignore many of the messages, including some which urged him to release \u201cone or more of your father\u2019s tax returns.\u201d President Trump\u2019s attorney Ty Cobb told Fox News on Monday that he was not aware that Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s attorneys provided these documents to congressional investigators, but said there is likely no legal issue, from what he knows of the documents. Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange tweeted about the report on Monday, saying that the organization couldn\u2019t \u201cconfirm\u201d the messages with Trump Jr. Wikileaks \u201cdoes not keep such records and the Atlantic\u2019s presentation is edited and clearly does not have the full context,\u201d Assange wrote. \u201cWikiLeaks loves its pending publications and ignores those who ask for details,\u201d Assange continued. \u201cTrump Jr. was rebuffed just like Cambridge Analytica. In both cases WikiLeaks had publicly teased the publications. Thousands of people asked about them. WikiLeaks can be very effective at convincing even high profile people that it is their interest to promote links to its publications. \u201cWikiLeaks has such chutzpah that it allegedly tried to convince Trump Jr to leak his father\u2019s tax returns & his own \u201cRussian lawyer meeting\u201d emails (he did),\u201d Assange wrote. \u201cWikiLeaks appears to beguile some people into transparency by convincing them that it is in their interest.\u201d Assange also claimed that the \u201cfull text of alleged DMs with context provides a different reading, unsurprisingly.\u201d This is not the first time that Trump Jr. has been in the spotlight, and has had his actions brought into question amid the larger probe into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election. In June 2016, Trump Jr. accepted a now-highly scrutinized meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, after he allegedly was promised \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton. The meeting was brokered by music publicist Rob Goldstone who promised the campaign information. Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, who was charged last month in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian collusion, also attended the meeting.

According to messages obtained by The Atlantic\u2019s Julia Ioffe, Trump Jr. messaged with the WikiLeaks account between September 2016 and July 2017. The messages were given to congressional investigators probing whether Trump\u2019s presidential campaign colluded with Russian officials to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. (Federal officials believe WikiLeaks published material, including emails from the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers, that had been obtained via Russian hackers.) Trump Jr. later on Monday confirmed his correspondence with WikiLeaks, posting several screenshots of the Twitter messages. The messages are mostly from WikiLeaks to the president\u2019s son, but Trump Jr. did occasionally respond to the messages. The organization made multiple requests of Trump Jr., asking him to provide his father\u2019s tax returns and suggesting the candidate refuse to concede if he lost the election to Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. (Trump Jr. didn\u2019t respond to either message.) On one occasion, Trump Jr. tweeted a link to a cache of leaked emails after the WikiLeaks account messaged it to him. On another, WikiLeaks wrote it was happy to see the elder Trump mentioning the group on the campaign trail. Moments later, Trump tweeted about the organization. After Trump won the election, Wikileaks suggested that Trump should prod Australia to appoint the site\u2019s founder, Julian Assange, ambassador to the United States. The White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment on the report. In a statement to The Atlantic, Trump Jr.\u2019s attorney, Alan Futerfas, said, \u201cWe can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence, who in an Oct. 14, 2016, interview with Fox News claimed the campaign had not been in contact with WikiLeaks, said in a statement late Monday that he had not known about Trump Jr.\u2019s messages. \u201cThe vice president was never aware of anyone associated with the campaign being in contact with WikiLeaks,\u201d said Pence press secretary Alyssa Farah. \u201cHe first learned of this news from a published report earlier tonight.\u201d Weeks before the election, asked if the campaign was \u201cin cahoots\u201d with WikiLeaks, Pence denied it. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cI think all of us have, you know, have had concerns about WikiLeaks over the years, and it\u2019s just a reality of American life today, and of life in the wider world.\u201d Trump Jr. became embroiled in the Russia investigation after it was revealed he and other campaign officials met with a Kremlin-backed attorney in June 2016 who had promised damaging information about Clinton. Leaked emails published by The New York Times show Trump Jr. arranged the meeting at Trump Tower in New York. \u201cTo the extent they had information concerning the fitness, character or qualifications of a presidential candidate, I believed that I should at least hear them out,\u201d Trump Jr. said in a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of the congressional committees probing the campaign\u2019s Russia ties, in September. He said the meeting did not lead to anything, and has denied colluding with the Russian government.

        "body": " HARTFORD, Conn. \u2014 Connecticut Attorney General and U.S. Senate candidate Richard Blumenthal is defending himself against a report he misstated his military service in Vietnam. Blumenthal's campaign called a New York Times report which includes video of him at a 2008 event saying he had served \"in Vietnam\" an \"outrageous distortion\" on his record. Here's an excerpt from the Times report: \"\"We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam,\" Mr. Blumenthal said to the group gathered in Norwalk in March 2008. \"And you exemplify it. Whatever we think about the war, whatever we call it -- Afghanistan or Iraq -- we owe our military men and women unconditional support.\" There was one problem: Mr. Blumenthal, a Democrat now running for the United States Senate, never served in Vietnam. He obtained at least five military deferments from 1965 to 1970 and took repeated steps that enabled him to avoid going to war, according to records.\" Blumenthal says he's always tried to make it clear his Marine Reserve service never took him overseas. But, the Times reported, \"an examination of his remarks at the ceremonies shows that he does not volunteer that his service never took him overseas. And he describes the hostile reaction directed at veterans coming back from Vietnam, intimating that he was among them.\" Blumenthal told the Times he had misspoken at the 2008 event in Norfolk in which he said he served in Vietnam. In a televised March debate, Blumenthal stated clearly he had not served in Vietnam. Blumenthal's campaign said he planned an event Tuesday with veterans showing their support for him. Kevin Rennie, a former Republican state lawmaker, published a blog post stating that the Times piece was \"fed to the paper by the Linda McMahon [Senate] campaign.\" McMahon, the CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, is one of the Republican Senate candidates running to face Blumenthal in November. Rennie wrote: \"The Blumenthal Bombshell comes at the end of more than 2 months of deep, persistent research by Republican Linda McMahon's Senate campaign. It gave the explosive Norwalk video recording to The Times. This is what comes of $16 million, a crack opposition research operation and an opponent who, in the words of the president Blumenthal worked for on a draft deferment, who gave them the sword.\" Rennie's article was initially re-posted on Linda McMahon's website, but the story has since been removed. On Tuesday morning, a set of response points were circulated by Democrats close to Blumenthal's campaign: -Here are the facts: unlike many of his peers, Dick Blumenthal voluntarily joined the Marine Corps Reserves in 1970 and served for six months in Parris Island, SC and six years in the reserves. He received no special treatment from anyone. Today's story unfortunately distorts Dick Blumenthal's record of service by implying that he did not serve. -In the past twenty years, Dick has attended literally hundreds of vets events, debates, news conferences where he was clear, honest, and proud about his service in the Marine Corps Reserve. In fact, as recently as the US Senate debate on March 1, 2010, Blumenthal clearly stated \"serving in the United States military gave me a perspective as well, even in the reserves. Although I did not serve in Vietnam, I have seen first-hand the affects of military action, and no one wants it to be the first resort, nor do we want to mortgage the countries future....\" -Dick has been a constant champion of veterans and of the military. Today Connecticut veterans will come together to show they have his back, just like he has had theirs. -On a few occasions out of hundreds, Dick misspoke and he'll be the first to admit that those were mistakes. That doesn't take anything away from Dick's service or his long record of standing up for veterans - he is known throughout the state as a strong advocate for vets services and benefits. -His opponent's campaign admits they are the ones who cherry-picked the quotes and are behind the hit piece. It is no surprise Linda McMahon would want to smear the Attorney General, considering all of the debauchery at the WWF under her watch, including her attempt to interfere with an investigation into widespread drug abuse. UPDATE: Richard Blumenthal defended himself against charges that he repeatedly made misleading comments about his military service during a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. Details here.",

Cruz vehemently denied the rumors, which rippled through the Washington media establishment on Friday. \"I want to be crystal clear: these attacks are garbage,\" Cruz said Friday in a statement posted on Facebook. Earlier in the day, the allegations spilled over into an almost surreal exchange on CNN between Cruz's former communications director Amanda Carpenter and Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen, in which Cohen accused Carpenter of having an affair with Cruz. \"You\u2019ve been named as well, Amanda,\" Cohen said, referring to the National Enquirer piece. Trump responded to Cruz's allegations in a statement on Friday afternoon: \u201cI have no idea whether or not the cover story about Ted Cruz in this week's issue of the National Enquirer is true or not, but I had absolutely nothing to do with it, did not know about it, and have not, as yet, read it.

John Edwards (D-N.C.) and golfer Tiger Woods. Reached for comment, a spokesman for American Media Inc., the Enquirer's parent company, also denied that the story had been influenced by Trump backers. \"No one influences the reporting that The National Enquirer does other than our own reporters and editors.

        "body": " Report Sees Guns as Path to Safety in Schools WASHINGTON \u2014 With the Senate set to debate gun control this month, a National Rifle Association task force released a 225-page report on Tuesday that called for armed police officers, security guards or staff members in every American school, and urged states to loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons. Asa Hutchinson, a former Republican congressman from Arkansas who led the task force, unveiled the report at a packed news conference with unusually heavy security, including a bomb-sniffing yellow Labrador retriever. A dozen officers in plain clothes and uniforms stood watch as he spoke; one warned photographers to \u201cremain stationary\u201d during the event. Among the study\u2019s central conclusions is that \u201cthe presence of armed security personnel adds a layer of security and diminishes response time\u201d in a shooting, Mr. Hutchinson said. He cited a 1997 Mississippi case in which an assistant principal ran to his truck to retrieve a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol and subdued a gunman who had killed two students. The recommendations \u2014 which also included expanding the police presence in schools \u2014 drew immediate criticism from gun control advocates and many Democrats, who have been fighting to tighten gun restrictions after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December. \u201cArming the teacher is merely a response to the last tragedy,\u201d said Representative Mike Thompson, a California Democrat who is chairman of a House task force on gun violence. \u201cThe one before that was in a shopping mall in Oregon, and the one before that was in a movie theater in Colorado. I don\u2019t think the proper response is to arm all the projectionists in the movie theaters or all the vendors in the mall.\u201d After the Newtown shooting, Wayne LaPierre, the rifle association\u2019s executive director, announced that it would devise a plan to put armed guards in every school. Technically, Mr. Hutchison\u2019s task force is independent of the rifle association, even though it paid for the study, and Mr. LaPierre was not present on Tuesday. But critics see no distinction between the two. Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, an advocacy group here, criticized the study as \u201cnothing more than a continuation of the N.R.A.\u2019s attempts to prey on America\u2019s fears, saturate our schools with more guns and turn them into armed fortresses.\u201d But the report did get support from at least one Newtown parent: Mark Mattioli, whose 6-year-old son, James, was killed. \u201cI think politics needs to be set aside here, and I hope this doesn\u2019t lead to name-calling,\u201d said Mr. Mattioli, who joined Mr. Hutchinson at the news conference. \u201cThis is a recommendation for solutions, real solutions that will make our kids safer. That\u2019s what we need.\u201d At least one state, Indiana, is considering the idea of armed officers at schools. On Tuesday, a proposal that would require public and charter schools to have an armed \u201cprotection officer\u201d on school property during class hours passed a State House committee. The task force panel called on the Departments of Homeland Security, Education and Justice to coordinate school safety efforts and provide grant money for schools to assess their ability to prevent and respond to attacks. It recommended that officers or employees who are armed take a 40- to 60-hour training course to be developed by the rifle association based on a model the task force has designed. The group also called on states to require schools to develop security plans. But how and whether the task force recommendations will be put into effect \u2014 and the cost \u2014 was unclear. The timing of Tuesday\u2019s announcement was not a coincidence: Congress will wrap up its spring recess after this week and is expected to consider gun legislation after lawmakers return. President Obama has called for tough new controls on gun ownership, but the prospects for such legislation are murky \u2014 a testimony to the rifle association\u2019s prowess as a lobbying force. A plan to revive and revamp a ban on assault weapons, which expired in 2004, is almost certain to be defeated. Mr. Obama is pushing for a measure that would impose mandatory background checks for gun buyers, and the Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the majority leader, has promised to present a bill that would expand background checks to the floor for a vote.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2015House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) was still in critical condition on Thursday after a lone gunman opened fire Wednesday morning on a group of Republican lawmakers practicing for a congressional baseball game. Six people, including two congressmen, two police officers, a congressional aide and a lobbyist, were injured in the attack in an Alexandria, Virginia, park. The assailant, who authorities have identified as 66-year-old James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois, was shot by police and later died of his injuries at a hospital. Scalise underwent surgery at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center after being shot in the hip. In a statement Wednesday night, the hospital said Scalise sustained \u201ca single rifle shot to the left hip\u201d that \u201ctravelled across his pelvis, fracturing bones, injuring internal organs and causing severe bleeding.\u201d \u201cHe underwent immediate surgery and an additional procedure to stop bleeding,\u201d the hospital said, noting the congressman had received multiple blood transfusions and remained in critical condition late Wednesday. It said Scalise would need further operations. Before the surgery, Scalise was \u201cin good spirits and spoke to his wife by phone,\u201d his office said. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump on Wednesday night visited Scalise in the hospital, bringing flowers and offering support to the lawmaker\u2019s family. The Trumps also met with Crystal Griner, one of the two U.S. Capitol Police officers injured in the attack, and her wife. Griner and David Bailey, the other officer hurt, are in stable condition, according to Chief Matthew R. Verderosa. Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence also checked in on Scalise and Griner on Thursday. Zachary Barth, a staffer for Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas), was shot in the leg. He was transported to a local hospital and has since been released. Williams sustained a minor leg injury. Matt Mika, director of government relations for Tyson Foods\u2019 Washington, D.C., office, was also among those shot. His condition was upgraded from \u201ccritical\u201d to \u201cserious\u201d on Thursday, a spokeswoman for George Washington University Hospital confirmed to HuffPost. The attack took place shortly after 7 a.m. at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park, less than 8 miles south of the White House. U.S. Capitol Police officers assigned to Scalise engaged Hodgkinson in gunfire, and Alexandria Police responded soon after. \u201cAt that point, we were able to calm the situation, and victims were transported to the hospital,\u201d Verderosa said. The FBI is investigating Hodgkinson and his possible motives. It\u2019s too early to determine whether the attack was politically motivated, authorities said. The shooter\u2019s weapons \u2015 a 9 mm handgun and 7.62-caliber rifle \u2015 were recovered at the scene by law enforcement officials. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ran traces on the weapons and found no evidence to suggest Hodgkinson purchased the firearms illegally, according to an FBI statement released Thursday. The FBI said it was processing a cell phone, a computer and a camera recovered from Hodgkinson\u2019s van, which was in the parking lot of a YMCA adjacent to the park. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) confirmed on Wednesday that Hodgkinson had volunteered for his presidential campaign. \u201cLet me be as clear as I can be,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \u201cViolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms.\u201d Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who was also at the practice, told MSNBC that Scalise crawled through the dirt, bleeding, to get away from the shooter. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) told reporters that he used his belt as a tourniquet to stop a staffer\u2019s bleeding. Paul said that a number of aides were lying down during the attack as the shooter fired bullets their way. Paul told CNN that \u201cnobody would\u2019ve survived\u201d had Capitol Police not been there. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been a massacre without them,\u201d he said. Noah Nathan, 47, lives in a nearby apartment building and was at the dog park when the shooting took place. He said he heard at least 30 shots and got down on the ground, but couldn\u2019t see the shooter. \u201cThere\u2019s no place I could go,\u201d he said. The members were practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game, a D.C. tradition dating back to 1909. The event pits Republicans against Democrats and raises funds for area nonprofits, including the Washington Literacy Center, the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Washington and the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation. This year\u2019s game is scheduled for Thursday night. Police shut down the streets for blocks around the field early Wednesday, and a helicopter was flying overhead. A lockdown has been lifted at the YMCA Alexandria, next to the field where the shooting took place, spokeswoman Dana Rucker told HuffPost. No members or staff were harmed in the shooting, but the building sustained bullet damage. \u201cThey are shaken,\u201d Rucker said of YMCA staff. \u201cThey\u2019re just grateful everyone was able to work together as a team and get out.\u201d Hodgkinson was member of the YMCA, Rucker said in a statement. She said that while he appears to have visited the facility \u201cfrequently and at all hours of the day,\u201d staff received \u201cno complaints\u201d about his behavior. Lawmakers from both parties expressed sympathy for the victims. Trump said that he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the news. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with the members of Congress, their staffs, Capitol Police, first responders, and all others affected,\u201d he said in a statement. During a bipartisan briefing on Capitol Hill later Wednesday, lawmakers discussed the possibility of allowing members of Congress to use campaign funds to bolster security at their private residences. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a review of exactly what funds can and should be used in the event there are security concerns by any member,\u201d said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.). He added that Ryan was investigating the matter alongside the Federal Election Commission. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at that,\u201d Hoyer said. Many previously scheduled events around Capitol Hill were canceled Wednesday, including an event Trump was scheduled to attend at the Department of Labor. The FBI is taking over the investigation into the shooting, Alexandria Police Chief Michael Brown said. Jay Roberts, 60, lives nearby and said the game was \u201cprobably one of the few moments with all this rancor and politics that they can have some normalcy.\u201d \u201cI imagined it would be something fun to watch, you know, because evidently it\u2019s partisan politics are put aside, let\u2019s have a softball game, let\u2019s have some fun,\u201d he said.",

The article said that Cohen\u2019s testimony \u201cmarks a significant new frontier: It is the first known example of Trump explicitly telling a subordinate to lie directly about his own dealings with Russia.\u201d BuzzFeed also reported that Trump backed a plan, set up by Cohen, to visit Russia during the presidential campaign, meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in person and begin the negotiations. Mueller\u2019s team is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and rarely issues statements about the state of the investigation or disputing reports in the press. But on Friday, after Democrats had called for investigations and hinted at impeachment proceedings, the special counsel\u2019s office took the extraordinary step of releasing a statement disputing the article. \u201cBuzzFeed\u2019s description of specific statements to the special counsel\u2019s office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u2019s Congressional testimony are not accurate,\u201d Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller\u2019s office, said.  It did not offer further details about what it disputed. BuzzFeed\u2019s editor in chief, Ben Smith, later tweeted that \u201cwe stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what he\u2019s disputing.\u201d Trump\u2019s team had also denied the claims in the article.  Trump himself said Friday evening that the controversy was \u201ca very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our country.\u201d Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on Friday also praised Mueller\u2019s office for \u201ccorrecting the Buzzfeed false story\u201d and asked the press to take heed that their hysterical desire to destroy this President has gone too far.\u201d In a statement Saturday aftternoon, BuzzFeed spokesman Matt Mittenthal doubled down on the organization's defense of its reporting. \u201cAs we\u2019ve re-confirmed our reporting, we\u2019ve seen no indication that any specific aspect of our story is inaccurate.  We remain confident in what we\u2019ve reported, and will share more as we are able,\" he said. ",

        "body": " Donald Trump is investing more in the conspiracy theories about President Obama\u2019s birth certificate as he explores his own bid for the presidency. In his latest embrace of the birther strategy, Mr. Trump has invited Tea Party leaders and a legislator from Arizona to his office in Manhattan on Friday morning to discuss a bill moving through the Arizona legislature that would require candidates for president to prove that they are natural born citizens. The Arizona group said the call from Mr. Trump on Wednesday came unexpectedly, and the group had spent much of the day Thursday scurrying to make travel arrangements to New York. \u201cOf course I was surprised, who wouldn\u2019t be?\u201d said the legislator, Representative Carl Seel. \u201cI\u2019m honored to get the ability to meet with him and discuss it, and I want to thank him for being such a supporter of this issue.\u201d In an interview shown Thursday on the \u201cToday\u201d show, Mr. Trump told Meredith Vieira that he had \u201creal doubts\u201d about whether Mr. Obama was born in this country, and that he has sent his own investigators to Hawaii to research the issue. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed Mr. Trump as the most favored candidate among Republicans who consider themselves Tea Party supporters. Mr. Obama has shown a certificate of live birth from Hawaii, which is the standard form of birth certificate in the state, and state officials \u2013 including the Republican who was governor during the 2008 campaign \u2013 have confirmed its authenticity. Several conservatives, including Glenn Beck and Bill O\u2019Reilly, have criticized Mr. Trump for raising questions about it. But polls show that many Republicans continue to believe that Mr. Obama was not born in this country, and therefore is not eligible to be president. Kelly Townsend, a founder of the Greater Phoenix Tea Party, said Mr. Trump told them that he was interested in learning more about the legislation in Arizona. The bill, which has been approved by committees of the House and Senate, allows great latitude to the secretary of state in denying a presidential candidate a spot on the ballot, saying that the secretary can do so if he or she believes that the documents do not prove citizenship. \u201cIt\u2019s not a birther bill,\u201d Ms. Townsend said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about Mr. Obama. It\u2019s about preventing any questions from coming up in the future, putting something in place so no one could question it.\u201d But a release from Mr. Seel\u2019s office about the planned meeting noted that Mr. Trump \u201chas brought the issue of President Barack Obama failing to provide a birth certificate front and center recently.\u201d Ms. Townsend said she had her own agenda for the meeting at Trump Tower. \u201cI want to invite him to Arizona to talk to people and to meet our leaders,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he\u2019d have a good audience with Tea Partiers.\u201d",

The gory photo first published in TMZ from Griffin's photo session with the famed Shields, known for his shocking pictures. In a Twitter post late Tuesday, Griffin said the image \"is too disturbing,\" and that \"it wasn't funny.\" \"I understand how it offends people,\" she said, adding \"I've made a lot of mistakes in my career.\" According to the gossip site, Griffin joked with Shields on set they would need to move to Mexico after the photos were released or fear imprisonment. In her Twitter post on Tuesday, Griffin said she was going to \"take down the image.\" \"I went too far and I was wrong,\" she said. People took to Twitter to express their disdain for the photo shoot. Reps for Griffin did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment. Chelsea Clinton called it \"vile and wrong\" in a Twitter post. Shields told Fox News that Griffin was hoping to create a bold message. \"Kathy and I are friends and we worked together before, so when we started doing this shoot, she said, 'I'd love to do something political. I'd love to make a statement,'\" he explained. \"We kind of figured out what would be the best image to make out of that.\" Shields added the image was meant to serve as art and he's aware that it could make some viewers uncomfortable. \"That's what art is meant to do,\" he said. \"Some people look at it and they love it. Some people look at it and they hate it... I understand there are going to be people that hate this. It's a very touchy subject... but this is not real. We didn't kill anybody nor do I feel anybody should be killed. It's no different from a movie. It just happens to be a still image.\" Shields tweeted a link to a YouTube video called \"Behind the scenes with Kathy Griffin\" but the video has since been removed. However, he later told Fox News that the video had glitches, which prompted him to take it down and then re-upload it. This is hardly the first time Shields' photos have caused uproar. He previously received death threats over a photo he took of \"Glee\" actress Heather Morris with bruises on her face. The photo was criticized for making light of domestic abuse. As for his recent collaboration with Griffin, he doesn't regret it. \"I can't speak for her, [but] I know she loves to stir the pot,\" he said. \"For me, I love the idea we have freedom of speech. The fact that I'm allowed to make an image like this says a lot. To me, that's a powerful thing... nobody's killed me for this image so it's not that bad.

Michele Bachmann has declined to get into the scrum with Newsweek over its cover story of the presidential candidate called \"The Queen of Rage,\" accompanied by an unflattering photo of the Minnesota Republican, but others are calling the magazine out of bounds in its depiction. The National Organization for Women President Terry O'Neill said that the cover of the magazine's latest edition is \"sexist\" and referred to a simple test by the group's founder Gloria Steinem to explain how they determined that conclusion -- would the magazine do the same to a man. \"Who has ever called a man 'The King of Rage?' Basically what Newsweek magazine -- and this is important, what Newsweek magazine, not a blog, Newsweek magazine -- what they are saying of a woman who is a serious contender for president of the United States of America\u2026 They are basically casting her as a nut job,\" O'Neill said to The Daily Caller and NOW confirmed to FoxNews.com on Tuesday. \"The 'Queen of Rage' is something you apply to wrestlers or somebody who is crazy. They didn\u2019t even do this to Howard Dean when he had his famous scream,\" she said. Newsweek has defended the photo -- an extreme close-up of the crystal blue-eyed Bachmann looking over the camera with a dark blue background -- saying that several of the images taken of her appeared the same way. The magazine posted other photos of her on its website, and many of them are flattering. Bachmann was asked about the cover during an appearance in Iowa on Monday, where she is campaigning ahead of Thursday's Fox News/Washington Examiner debate and Saturday's Ames Straw Poll. She told voters she had not seen the cover. \"Ah-hah,\" she said when told the story headline. \"Well, we'll have to take a look at that, won't we?\" O'Neill said that the main reason her group, which disagrees with Bachmann on almost every issue, would stand up for and defend Bachmann against \"these kind of misogynistic attacks is we want women to run for office.\" \"Of course my job is to defeat Michele Bachmann and I intend to do so. But good women will not run for office if Newsweek magazine can do this to such a prominent politician and get away with it,\" O'Neill said. Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center and ForAmerica, said he's not surprised by the magazine cover. \"Both Time and Newsweek have been doing this to conservatives for years. It is sheer journalistic dishonesty,\" Bozell told FoxNews.com. \"But it is precisely because of this journalistic dishonesty that conservatives should steer away from these venues -- or at least demand some form of editorial oversight given that these magazines simply cannot be trusted.\"",

        "body": " The FBI's pre-dawn arrest of President Trump's ex-adviser Roger Stone at his Florida home prompted critics to once again question the tactics of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, after more than a dozen special agents clad in tactical gear raided Stone's property Friday. Stone, 66, was taken into custody early Friday after being indicted by a federal grand jury a day earlier as part of Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.  CNN, which conveniently happened to be staking out Stone's Fort Lauderdale home, posted video of the arrest that showed a team of FBI agents with guns banging on Stone\u2019s door and demanding that he come outside. \u201cAt the crack of dawn, 29 FBI agents arrived at my home with 17 vehicles, with lights flashing, when they could have contacted my lawyer,\u201d Stone explained after a court appearance Friday.  \u201cBut the FBI agents were extraordinarily courteous.\u201d Stone will appear on Fox News Channel's \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on Friday at 8 p.m. ET. Stone\u2019s attorney added that the arrest was a \u201cspectacle.\u201d \u201cA SWAT team, searching the house, scaring his wife, scaring his dogs\u2014it was completely unnecessary,\u201d Stone\u2019s attorney said.  \u201cA telephone call would have done the job, and he would have appeared.  Mr. Stone has nothing to hide.\u201d The arrest operation drew scrutiny on social media\u2014even from President Trump, who said \u201cBorder Coyotes, Drug Dealers and Human Traffickers are treated better,\u201d and questioned \u201cwho alerted CNN to be there?\u201d One federal law enforcement source told Fox News on Friday that the operation was \u201cstandard\u201d for a home arrest.  The source told Fox News that home arrests typically take place early in the morning with a team of FBI agents in protective gear, adding that Stone\u2019s situation was \u201cnothing out of the ordinary.\u201d A former senior Justice Department official, now-white collar criminal attorney with Ifrah Law, James Trusty, told Fox News that while common procedure in white collar cases would involve a federal prosecutor contacting the defendant\u2019s attorney, Stone\u2019s charges could have sparked a different approach. \u201cIt shows that there is either a fundamental distrust of Mr. Stone, possibly due to the witness tampering charge, or that there was a real breakdown with his attorney,\u201d Trusty said Friday.  \u201cThe wild card here is that in charging Stone with a form of obstruction of justice, the Mueller team may view it differently than typical white-collar investigations.\u201d He added: \u201cIf the FBI and the Mueller team believe Stone has engaged in witness tampering, then there is a palpable distrust, which would make them err on the side of surprise, rather than a courtesy phone call.\u201d The 24-page indictment released early Friday alleges that Stone worked to obstruct the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election by making false statements to the committee, denying he had records sought by the committee and persuading a witness to provide false testimony. The indictment does not charge Stone with conspiring with WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy website that published the emails, or with the Russian officers Mueller says hacked them.  Instead, it accuses him of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements about his interactions related to WikiLeaks' release. But former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joseph diGenova blasted the tactic as \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cI am appalled that the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have permitted a vindictive use of arrest in a non-violent case with a defendant who was willing to surrender,\u201d diGenova, who has informally been an adviser to the president throughout the Russia investigation, told Fox News.  \u201cThis is an abuse of power and it underscores the vindictive nature of it by the fact that CNN was alerted ahead of time.\u201d He added: \u201cFor those of us who have been prosecutors and have prosecuted mob figures, drug dealers and terrorists\u2014those are the people for whom these aggressive tactics are reserved.  Not a Roger Stone.\u201d \u201cMake no mistake,\u201d he said.  \u201cThis was designed to be vindictive and intimidating.\u201d DiGenova likened the FBI arrest of Stone to the bureau\u2019s early morning raid last summer of the home of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Stone on Friday said he would plead not guilty to the charges leveled against him by the special counsel\u2019s team, and said he \u201clooks forward to being fully and completely vindicated.\u201d \u201cI believe this is a politically motivated investigation,\u201d Stone said Friday.  \u201cThere is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies.\u201d Stone served as an adviser to Trump for years before Trump ran for president.  He left Trump\u2019s campaign in August 2015, but maintained regular contact with and publicly supported the Trump campaign throughout the 2016 presidential election. Mueller\u2019s investigation, which was initially ordered to look into the 2016 election, has gone on for more than a year and half.  It has expanded to probe financial crimes of Trump associates before the election, conversations Trump\u2019s national security adviser had with the Russians during the transition and whether Trump obstructed justice with his comments and actions related to the probe. Twenty-six Russian nationals and three Russian companies have been charged with interfering in the 2016 presidential election.  But none of the Trump associates connected to Trump have been charged with crimes related to collusion. Other convictions include former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who both pleaded guilty to making false statements in 2017.  Former campaign adviser Rick Gates in 2018 pleaded guilty and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted and later pleaded guilty in a separate financial crimes case dating back before the 2016 election. Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements in a case brought by Mueller in November.  Alex van der Zwaan, a London-based lawyer, pleaded guilty to making false statements this year, and Richard Pinedo, a California man, pleaded guilty to identity fraud in 2018.",

We've got a big challenge, and we've got work to do.\" Democrats face an uphill battle in their efforts to take back the House, where Republicans hold a 242-190 seat advantage. And control of the Senate could be up for grabs this year, too, with Democrats clinging to a fragile six-vote majority. The oddsmakers who track congressional races with obsessive dedication project a handful of pickups for Republicans in the Senate -- but not necessarily enough to get to 51. In the House, a flurry of redistricting decisions appears to be working as of late in the Democrats' favor, though the chaotic process has stung both parties repeatedly. The Democrats would need 25 seats in the House to regain the majority -- a very steep climb in a year when neither party is particularly popular. However, Democrats are thought to have far more safe seats than Republicans going into November. Earlier this year, the Rothenberg Political Report projected a Democratic pick-up of between five and 12 seats. In total, 33 Senate seats are in play this year, with 23 currently held by Democrats and 10 held by Republicans. Ten of those 33 seats are open -- again, the state of play is in the Republicans' favor, with seven held by Democrats and three held by Republicans. But while Republicans have several opportunities to pick off those Democrat-held seats, three races in particular could undermine those potential gains for the GOP. Republican Sens. Scott Brown in Massachusetts and Dean Heller in Nevada, who was appointed to fill the vacancy left by John Ensign, are both considered vulnerable. And Sen. Olympia Snowe, a Republican from Maine, said she wouldn't seek re-election this year.",

        "body": " Obama Willing to Use Executive Orders on Guns WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama this week will embrace a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence that will call for major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and lay out 19 separate actions the president could take by invoking the power of his office, lawmakers who were briefed on the plan said Monday. Lawmakers and other officials said that the president could use a public event as soon as Wednesday to signal his intention to engage in the biggest Congressional fight over guns in nearly two decades, focusing on the heightened background checks and including efforts to ban assault weapons and their high-capacity clips. But given the difficulty of pushing new rules through a bitterly divided Congress, Mr. Obama will also promise to act on his own to reduce gun violence wherever possible. Actions the president could take on his own are likely to include imposing new limits on guns imported from overseas, compelling federal agencies to improve sharing of mental health records and directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on gun violence, according to those briefed on the effort. White House aides believe Mr. Obama can also ratchet up enforcement of existing laws, including tougher prosecution of people who lie on their background checks. At a news conference on Monday, exactly one month after the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Obama said a task force led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had \u201cpresented me now with a list of sensible, common-sense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kinds of violence we saw at Newtown doesn\u2019t happen again. He added: \u201cMy starting point is not to worry about the politics. My starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works.\u201d The administration\u2019s strategy reflects the uncertainty of gun politics in America and the desire by White House officials to address the Connecticut shooting while also confronting the broader deficiencies in the country\u2019s criminal justice and mental health systems. By proposing to use the independent power of his office, Mr. Obama is inviting political attacks by gun owners who have already expressed fear that he will abuse that authority to restrict their rights. Representative Steve Stockman, Republican of Texas, threatened Monday to file articles of impeachment if the president seeks to regulate guns with executive orders. \u201cI will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary,\u201d Mr. Stockman said in a statement. White House officials and Democratic lawmakers said that there are clear limits to what the president can and cannot do, and that Mr. Obama has no plans to push beyond what he would need Congressional authority to accomplish. On Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama\u2019s legislative effort will face intense opposition from gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, and the lawmakers they support with millions of dollars at election time and who see gun rights as a defining issue in their districts. But Mr. Obama\u2019s allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after Congress has shied away from the politically charged issue for years. \u201cHe\u2019s putting together a pretty comprehensive list of what could be done to make a difference in this area,\u201d said Representative Mike Thompson of California, who is heading a Democratic task force in the House. \u201cThere\u2019s some huge, huge holes in the process that are set up to keep communities safe. We need to close those holes.\u201d Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, said Vice President Biden had informed lawmakers during a two-hour briefing on Monday that there are \u201c19 independent steps that the president can take by executive order.\u201d Ms. Speier said the executive action is part of the \u201cmost comprehensive gun safety effort in a generation.\u201d Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago and Mr. Obama\u2019s former chief of staff, joined the debate on Monday and said that the president should \u201cclear the table\u201d by doing whatever he can administratively so small issues do not get in the way of the bigger legislative fights over access to guns. \u201cDon\u2019t allow a side issue to derail these things,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said during a discussion about gun policy. While many gun control advocates are eager to harness what they believe is a ripe moment in American life for new and robust restrictions on the kinds of guns that were used in Newtown, there is an emerging consensus on Capitol Hill and among gun education groups that improving the system of background check legislation that currently exempts private gun sales and gun shows is the most viable legislative route to pursue. \u201cThe assault-weapons ban is a low priority relative to the other measures the Biden task force is considering,\u201d Matt Bennett, a spokesman for Third Way, a left-leaning research group, said after hearing from Mr. Biden last week. \u201cPolitical capital in the gun debate only goes so far. We think it should be spent on things that would have the greatest impact on gun violence, like universal background checks and cracking down on gun trafficking.\u201d Any efforts to get gun legislation through Congress will require an enormous and ceaseless pressure campaign by the administration. Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden are likely to keep up the pressure on lawmakers with public events in the weeks and months ahead, according to those familiar with the White House strategy. Scores of senators, including many Democrats, will be wary of voting on any effort to curb access to guns or ammunition. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, is a longtime supporter of gun rights. Still, gun legislation is likely to begin in the Senate because the House is controlled by Republicans, many of whom oppose new restrictions on guns. With fiscal issues continuing to dominate the political calendar for the next several weeks, White House officials and lawmakers say the gun safety effort is likely to be debated in separate pieces of legislation that could be introduced over time. In coming weeks, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, will reintroduce a measure that would require every gun buyer, with limited exceptions, to undergo a background check and would force states to feed all relevant data into the background check system so those with criminal convictions and the mentally ill could be flagged.",

        "body": " It looks like President Trump is having a change of heart when it comes to his recent decision to lift the ban on importing elephant trophies from Africa. In a tweet on Friday night, Trump said he decided to put the \"big game trophy decision on hold.\u201d The comment comes less than 48 hours after it was first announced that the Trump administration would reverse a 2014 ban made under President Obama on permits for elephant trophies from Zambia and Zimbabwe. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke echoed Trump's comment in his own tweet, saying that he and the president had spoken and \"both believe that conservation & healthy herds are critical...the issuing of permits is put on hold...\" It was not immediately clear why Trump made the announcement, but it came on the same day as the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee called on the Trump administration to reverse its newly announced policy, labeling it the \"wrong move at the wrong time.\" California Rep. Ed Royce on Friday questioned the action because of concerns not only about African wildlife but U.S. national security, citing the political upheaval in Zimbabwe, where the longtime president was placed under house arrest this week by the military. \"The administration should withdraw this decision until Zimbabwe stabilizes,\" the committee chairman said in a statement. \"Elephants and other big game in Africa are blood currency for terrorist organizations, and they are being killed at an alarming rate. Stopping poaching isn't just about saving the world's most majestic animals for the future \u2014 it's about our national security.\" Royce said that when carefully regulated, conservation hunts could help the wildlife population, but \"that said, this is the wrong move at the wrong time.\" The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a written notice issued Thursday that permitting elephants from Zimbabwe and Zambia to be brought back as trophies will raise money for conservation programs. The change marks a shift in efforts to stop the importation of elephant tusks and hides, overriding a 2014 ban imposed by the Obama administration. The newly announced policy applies to the remains of African elephants killed between January 2016 and December 2018. \"Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve those species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation,\" the agency said in a statement. The illicit demand for elephant ivory has led to devastating losses from illegal poaching as the natural habitat available for the animals to roam has also dwindled by more than half. As a result, the number of African elephants has shrunk from about 5 million a century ago to about 400,000 remaining. And that number continues to decline each year. Two other lawmakers, Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., and Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., co-chairs of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, assailed the administration's decision.",

        "body": " CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 Democratic presidential candidates wasted no time Friday evening demanding the immediate public release of the long-awaited report from Robert S. Mueller III, with several saying that Americans deserved to know any findings about President Trump, Russia and the 2016 election in order to form judgments about Mr. Trump and the 2020 race. Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, campaigning in South Carolina on Friday night, told reporters that \u201cthose facts, that truth, needs to be laid out for all Americans to be able to make informed decisions going forward, whether at the ballot box\u201d or in their discussions with their senators and representatives. Mr. O\u2019Rourke, asked if he supported impeaching Mr. Trump, said he believed the president and his 2016 campaign \u201cat least sought to collude with the Russian government to undermine our democracy\u201d and that Mr. Trump \u201csought to obstruct justice\u201d once in office. \u201cI think those are grounds enough for members of the House to bring up the issue of impeachment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut whether they do or not, this will ultimately be decided by the American public at the ballot box in South Carolina and in every state of the union.\u201d No voters brought up the Mueller report to Mr. O\u2019Rourke as he spoke to them Friday. Indeed, in the hours after the announcement of the report, Democratic candidates reacted over Twitter or in remarks at events rather than in back-and-forth conversations with voters. Several candidates, in calling for the swift release of the report, also sought to gather new supporters and their email addresses by putting out \u201cpetitions\u201d calling for complete transparency from the Justice Department. \u201cThe Trump Administration shouldn\u2019t get to lock up Robert Mueller\u2019s report and throw away the key,\u201d Senator Cory Booker argued on Twitter, asking people to sign a petition and provide their names and emails. Such information is often used for future fund-raising solicitations. Within hours of Mr. Mueller\u2019s completing his investigation, Senator Elizabeth Warren and the campaign arm of House Democrats were already placing ads on Facebook demanding the full report\u2019s release, with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee seeking 100,000 signatures for its online petition. With no detailed information available about the report, Ms. Warren and Mr. Booker \u2014 as well as Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris \u2014 sought to focus attention and pressure on how quickly Attorney General William P. Barr would release the full report. \u201cAttorney General Barr \u2014 release the Mueller report to the American public. Now,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote on Twitter. Ms. Gillibrand made similar demands and also retweeted the news of the report along with three words: \u201cSee you Sunday.\u201d That is when Ms. Gillibrand plans to formally kick off her 2020 campaign in front of Trump International Tower in New York. Ms. Harris, in addition to calling for the report to be released \u201cimmediately,\u201d called on Mr. Barr to \u201cpublicly testify under oath about the investigation and its findings.\u201d Ms. Harris, Ms. Warren and Ms. Gillibrand also joined Mr. Booker and Senator Bernie Sanders in asking supporters to sign their petitions calling for the report\u2019s immediate release. Four other candidates \u2014 Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington; former Representative John Delaney; and Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2014 also called for the release of the full report. \u201cAs Donald Trump said, \u2019Let it come out,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sanders wrote on Twitter. \u201cI call on the Trump administration to make Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s full report public as soon as possible.

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The House Intelligence Committee\u2019s first hearing since Robert S. Mueller III completed his report had barely begun when the panel\u2019s Republicans moved en masse to demand the resignation of the committee\u2019s chairman. It went downhill from there. The acrimony on display Thursday as the intelligence committee tried to resume its work on Russia\u2019s intervention in the 2016 presidential election laid bare the bitter divide that persists in Congress even after Mr. Mueller, the special counsel, completed his 22-month investigation of the subject. The Republican demand and the barbed response of the committee\u2019s chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff, echoed well outside the wood-paneled House hearing room. Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, spent much of his weekly news conference comparing Mr. Schiff, a fellow Californian, to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, who fueled fears in the 1950s that Communist spies had infiltrated the American government. Representative Michael R. Turner, Republican of Ohio, played the same card in the hearing room, fuming that Mr. Schiff would not accept Attorney General William P. Barr\u2019s word that Mr. Mueller had not found the Trump campaign to have taken part in a conspiracy to undermine the election. \u201cWith McCarthyism,\u201d a senator was \u201cchasing after Russian Communists,\u201d Mr. Turner, an Intelligence Committee member, said. \u201cNow we have Schiff chasing after Russian collusion.\u201d Undaunted, Mr. Schiff made clear he was not about to step down, nor was he about to absolve President Trump or his campaign from nefarious conduct with Moscow \u2014 especially without seeing Mr. Mueller\u2019s report first. The Justice Department revealed on Thursday that the report came in at more than 300 pages, raising more questions about what information was behind the four-page summary released by Mr. Barr. Mr. Schiff had many questions of his own. \u201cYou might think that it\u2019s O.K. that the president\u2019s son-in-law sought to establish a secret back channel of communications with the Russians through a Russian diplomatic facility. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s O.K. You might think it\u2019s O.K. that an associate of the president made direct contact with the G.R.U. through Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks; that is considered a hostile intelligence agency,\u201d Mr. Schiff said, referring to Russian military intelligence and a Russian intelligence hacker. He continued: \u201cYou might think that it\u2019s O.K. that the national security-designate secretly conferred with the Russian ambassador about undermining U.S. sanctions. And you might think it\u2019s O.K. he lied about it to the F.B.I. You might say that\u2019s all O.K. You might say that\u2019s just what you need to do to win. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s O.K. I think it\u2019s immoral. I think it\u2019s unethical. I think it\u2019s unpatriotic. And yes, I think it\u2019s corrupt.\u201d Democrats who now control the House say that they will accept Mr. Mueller\u2019s findings, but as Mr. Schiff\u2019s monologue indicated they are increasingly determined not to let go of what they see as a deeply troubling pattern of wrongdoing by Mr. Trump, his businesses and his administration. That has in turn enraged Republicans, who have happily embraced what they call Mr. Mueller\u2019s absolution of Mr. Trump. They say Democrats will stop at nothing to ruin his presidency, and bristle at Democrats accusing them of turning a blind eye to the Russian threat. And at the center of their wrath is Mr. Schiff, whose doughy-faced demeanor hardly evokes an attack dog. \u201cThe findings of the special counsel conclusively refute your past and present assertions and have exposed you as having abused your position to knowingly promote false information, having damaged the integrity of this committee, and undermined faith in U.S. government institutions,\u201d Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, said to Mr. Schiff. Reading from a letter signed by every Republican member of the committee, Mr. Conaway added, \u201cYour actions both past and present are incompatible with your duties as chairman of this committee.\u201d Mr. Trump intervened as well, accusing Mr. Schiff of \u201cknowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking.\u201d He \u201cshould be forced to resign from Congress!\u201d the president wrote on Twitter. Mr. Schiff, clearly prepared for the ambush, argued that there was a difference between prosecutors proving a criminal conspiracy and the committee investigating evidence of foreign compromise. The committee\u2019s own investigative work would go on, he signaled, though outside the hearing room he has indicated that work may well need to shift course once Mr. Mueller\u2019s findings are fully understood. Democrats backed him. \u201cHistory will clarify what has happened,\u201d said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California praised Mr. Schiff as \u201ccalm, professional, patriotic,\u201d and said his work as the chairman of the committee has been \u201cin stark contrast to the irresponsible and almost criminal behavior of the previous chair of the committee,\u201d Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California. \u201cWhat is the president afraid of \u2014 that he would go after a chairman of the committee?\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re just scaredy-cats. They just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d The party gave Mr. Schiff a more formal nod of confidence this week as well. On Wednesday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, announced that Mr. Schiff would serve as a key fund-raiser for the caucus\u2019s most vulnerable members to help put together a firewall to project the House majority. Out of the glare of the television cameras, Democrats are somewhat more circumspect. \u201cIn the heat of the political moment just as the Republicans wanted to try to convict Hillary Clinton in the public sphere, Democrats probably contributed to the expectations that the outcome would be worse for the president than it was,\u201d Mr. Himes said in an interview a day ahead of the hearing. Notably sitting out the fight was Mr. Nunes, whom Democrats have accused of many of the same abuses that Republicans accused Mr. Schiff of on Thursday and whose resignation they asked for last year. Mr. Nunes\u2019s sustained work last term to scrutinize the origins of the Russia investigation and accuse federal law enforcement officials of acting out of anti-Trump political bias sent convulsions through what in quieter times is one of Congress\u2019s more bipartisan bodies. \u201cWe should not be used as a platform to spread false information and bizarre conspiracies,\u201d Mr. Nunes said on Thursday in brief remarks before deferring to Mr. Conaway. Thursday\u2019s showdown came, ironically enough, during a hearing with four subject experts on \u201cPutin\u2019s Playbook: The Kremlin\u2019s Use of Oligarchs, Money and Intelligence in 2016 and Beyond.\u201d Down the line, the witnesses warned that Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia would only grow bolder in its efforts to destabilize western democracies, including the United States. \u201cThe bad news is that there is a new ideological fight between Putinism and the West, and it has only just begun,\u201d said Michael McFaul, an ambassador to Moscow under former President Barack Obama. \u201cIn my estimation, we as a country are underestimating it.\u201d The whole episode offered a sharp contrast to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which with a yawning pace and no-leaks team has continued apace with its own Russia investigation. The committee\u2019s chairman, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, said this week that he aimed to finish witness interviews in the coming weeks and issue the last in a series of reports on the panel\u2019s findings in the coming months. On Thursday, as Democrats and Republicans in the House traded recriminations, the Senate panel quietly called back for another interview with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser.",

        "body": " Democrats in the Senate hoping to pass nonbudget-related legislation in the lame-duck session were put on notice by their Republican colleagues Wednesday morning: No tax-cut extension? No laws for you! In a letter signed by the 42 members of the Republican caucus, delivered to the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and mentioned Wednesday on the Senate floor by the minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republicans informed their Democratic counterparts that they would not go forward with \u201cany legislative item until the Senate has acted to fund the government and we have prevented the tax increase that is currently awaiting all American taxpayers.\u201d The letter goes on: \u201cWith little time left in this Congressional session, legislative scheduling should be focused on these critical priorities.  While there are other items that might ultimately be worthy of the Senate\u2019s attention, we cannot agree to prioritize any matters above the critical issues of funding the government and preventing a job-killing tax hike.\u201d Washington is locked in a battle over what to do about the Bush-era tax cuts, which expire at the end of the year.  President Obama and Democratic lawmakers want to extend the cuts to all Americans except those with income above $250,000, while Republicans want tax cuts extended to Americans at all income levels.  Another idea that has been kicking around over the last few weeks \u2014 proposed by some Democrats \u2014 is raising the expiration income ceiling to households with at least $1 million in income. At the same time, Congress needs to make a legislative move to keep the government funded before the 112th Congress takes over in January. Democrats were hoping to force a more ambitious agenda into the final weeks, including the ratification of the New Start treaty, a military authorization bill that would repeal the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d provision, the extension of unemployment funds and the Dream Act, an immigration bill. \u201cIf they really cared about creating jobs, they should stop blocking a preservation of unemployment insurance, which would create or save hundred of thousands of jobs,\u201d Jim Manley, a spokesman for Mr. Reid, said in an e-mail.  \u201cUnfortunately this letter is nothing new.  Republicans have simply put in writing their political strategy which they have pursued over the last two years: obstruct and delay action on critical matters, and then blame the Democrats for not addressing the needs of the American people.  This strategy is very cynical but very obvious and transparent.\u201d This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: December 1, 2010 Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this post said that Senator Harry Reid was from Arizona. He is from Nevada. Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, two of the strongest Republican critics of the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the Benghazi attack, offered support nonetheless for the nomination of Victoria Nuland, who helped edit the much-disputed talking points about the incident. President Obama and Gov. Chris Christie, Republican of New Jersey, will reprise their pre-election tour of the coastal areas ravaged by Hurricane Sandy on Tuesday, a White House official said Friday morning.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Jesse L. Jackson Jr., the former Democratic representative from Illinois, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to one felony fraud count in connection with his use of $750,000 in campaign money to pay for living expenses and buy items like stuffed animals, elk heads and fur capes. As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors recommended that Mr. Jackson receive a sentence of 46 to 57 months in prison. The federal judge overseeing the case, Robert L. Wilkins, is scheduled to sentence Mr. Jackson on June 28. \u201cFor years I lived off my campaign,\u201d Mr. Jackson, 47, said in response to questions from the judge about the plea. \u201cI used money I shouldn\u2019t have used for personal purposes.\u201d At one point during the hearing, the judge stopped his questioning of Mr. Jackson, who was crying, so that he could be given a tissue. \u201cGuilty, Your Honor \u2014 I misled the American people,\u201d Mr. Jackson said when asked whether he would accept the plea deal. Mr. Jackson\u2019s father, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, his mother and several brothers and sisters accompanied him to the hearing. Mr. Jackson\u2019s wife, Sandi, also accompanied him, and later in the day she pleaded guilty to a charge that she filed false income tax statements during the time that Mr. Jackson was dipping into his campaign treasury. Prosecutors said they would seek to have her sentenced to 18 to 24 months. Mr. Jackson\u2019s plea was yet another chapter in the downward spiral of his career. Elected to Congress in 1995 at the age of 30 from a district that includes part of the South Side of Chicago, Mr. Jackson was once one of the most prominent young black politicians in the country, working on issues related to health care and education for the poor. But as the federal authorities investigated Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois over his efforts to sell the Senate seat that President Obama vacated in 2008, they uncovered evidence that one of Mr. Jackson\u2019s friends had offered to make a contribution to Mr. Blagojevich\u2019s campaign in exchange for the seat. Since then, Mr. Jackson, who has said he had no knowledge of the offer, has been dogged by questions about his ethics. Last summer, Mr. Jackson took a medical leave from Congress and was later treated for bipolar disorder. After winning re-election in November, he resigned, citing his health and the federal investigation into his use of campaign money. After the hearing, Mr. Jackson\u2019s lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten, said his client had \u201ccome to terms with his misconduct.\u201d Mr. Weingarten said that Mr. Jackson had serious health issues that \u201cdirectly related\u201d to his conduct. \u201cThat\u2019s not an excuse, it\u2019s just a fact,\u201d Mr. Weingarten said. Court papers released by federal prosecutors on Wednesday provided new details about how Mr. Jackson and his wife used the $750,000 in campaign money to finance their lavish lifestyle. From 2007 to 2011, Mr. Jackson bought $10,977.74 worth of televisions, DVD players and DVDs at Best Buy, according to the documents. In 2008, Mr. Jackson used the money for things like a $466.30 dinner at CityZen in the Mandarin Oriental in Washington and a $5,587.75 vacation at the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Holistic Retreat, the document said. On at least two instances, Mr. Jackson and his wife used campaign money at Build-A-Bear Workshop, a store where patrons can create stuffed animals. From December 2007 through December 2008, the Jacksons spent $313.89 on \u201cstuffed animals and accessories for stuffed animals\u201d from Build-A-Bear, according to the documents. One of the more exotic items they bought was an elk head from a taxidermist in Montana. According to the documents, Mr. Jackson arranged in March 2011 to have $7,000 paid to the taxidermist, with much of the money coming from a campaign account, and it was shipped a month later to Mr. Jackson\u2019s Congressional office. A year later, Mr. Jackson\u2019s wife, knowing that the elk head had been bought with campaign money, had it moved from Washington to Chicago, and she asked a Congressional staff member to sell it, the documents say. In August 2012, the staff member sold the elk head for $5,300 to an interior designer and had the money wired to one of Mr. Jackson\u2019s accounts. What the staff member did not know was that the interior designer was actually an undercover F.B.I. employee who was investigating the Jacksons, the documents say. Documents released on Friday showed how Mr. Jackson used his campaign money to buy items like fur capes, celebrity memorabilia and expensive furniture. Among those items were a $5,000 football signed by American presidents and two hats that once belonged to Michael Jackson, including a $4,600 fedora.",

        "body": " A pending class action lawsuit against Wal-Mart that would be the largest of its kind in U.S. history may soon be dismissed, considering the tenor of oral arguments before the Supreme Court Tuesday. Although she may ultimately side with the plaintiffs, even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an ardent defender of women's rights, expressed some concerns about the particulars of the sex discrimination lawsuit that covers 1.5 million women and could cost the world's largest retailer billions of dollars. The key vote for a Wal-Mart victory could belong to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who said he was troubled by what he called an inconsistency in the women's lawsuit. \"Number one, you said this is a culture where Arkansas knows, the headquarters knows, everything that's going on,\" Kennedy told lawyer Joseph Sellers who represents the women. \"Then in the next breath, you say, well, now these (local) supervisors have too much discretion.\" The lawsuit alleges that the company's corporate culture, described in court Tuesday as the \"Wal-Mart Way,\" fosters the advancement of male workers over their female counterparts. It also claims that despite a company policy expressly prohibiting discrimination, local store managers are given too much flexibility in determining salary hikes and job promotions that invariably favor men over women. This dual argument that confounded Justice Kennedy also drew the ire of Justice Antonin Scalia who said he was whipsawed by the claims. \"If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion, you don't have discretion,\" he said. Chief Justice John Roberts also offered his doubts about the merits of lawsuit, suggesting that any discriminatory acts at Wal-Mart are no worse than anywhere else. \"Is it true that Wal-Mart's pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?\" he asked. Sellers said that wasn't a fair comparison because Wal-Mart has an obligation under federal law to make sure its managers do not discriminate. The case started a decade ago when Wal-Mart worker Betty Dukes said the management at her Pittsburg, Calif., store was bypassing her for promotions. \"I could see the men going forth and the women in the store stayed in the basic positions they were always in,\" Dukes once told an interviewer. Her discrimination claims were folded into a class action lawsuit covering all current female Wal-Mart employees and any who worked for the company going back to late 1998. Two lower courts said the case could move toward trial. Wal-Mart's appeal is asking the Supreme Court to stop the case from ever getting to a trial judge. On Tuesday, Dukes walked out of the courthouse full of confidence and poise saying she feels no anger toward her bosses or anyone else. \"Wal-Mart may be a big company and that is no doubt. But they are not big enough where they can't be challenged in a court of law. If you do wrong, then you should be held accountable. From the least of us to the greatest of us.\" Dukes's case has drawn the attention of the larger business community who fear that if the justices allow the case to proceed, it will open the doors to more class action lawsuits. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and major corporations including Bank of America, General Electric and Microsoft submitted briefs in the case supporting Wal-Mart. Much of the hour-long argument delved into the tedious details of class action law and if the Wal-Mart women could properly certify their claims into a single case. Wal-Mart lawyer Theodore Boutrous argued that every member of the class couldn't possibly meet a standard of commonality to justify the lawsuit. \"Our expert's report and testimony showed that at 90 percent of the stores, there was no pay disparity,\" Boutrous told the court. \"And that's the kind of -- and even putting that aside, the plaintiffs needed to come forward with something that showed that there was this miraculous recurrence at every decision across every store of stereotyping, and the evidence simply doesn't show that.\" Another technical concern that appears to work against the women covers the different types of remedies they are seeking. In addition to the punitive damages they want an injunction that would force Wal-Mart to adopt more stringent anti-discrimination policies. But those two remedies require different standards for class certification and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said it was \"a very serious problem\" in the case to try and sue for punitive damages after only obtaining certification under the lower threshold required for the injunction. It's possible that instead of an outright victory for Wal-Mart, the justices could issue a split decision of sorts and allow only the injunction part of the lawsuit to move forward. That potential ruling would get Wal-Mart off the hook for any financial damages.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2015 In recent years, the opposing party approached Supreme Court nomination hearings by honing in on the nominee\u2019s character and temperament or on one particular case that could possibly derail the nominee. Nominees have, in turn, generally refused to answer any question directly, in an appparent fear of revealing any bias about a potential future case they may hear. The four days of Senate Judiciary Committee hearings held this past week for President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to fill the late Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat, Judge Neil Gorsuch, were different. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee took a different tack. They made an argument against the Supreme Court itself and its false presentation as a body above politics and power. That judges do not, as Chief Justice John Roberts once famously said, only call \u201cballs and strikes.\u201d At the base of this argument was a simple question that has been dogging Democrats ever since the infamous Bush v. Gore decision on the 2000 presidential election: Is the Supreme Court rigged to benefit corporations, the wealthy and, well, Republicans? Pressing this question did not knock Gorsuch off his steady stream of non-answers. The polished Gorsuch certainly did not make any deluded or deranged statements, as many have come to expect from the president, that could lead a Republican to flip on his nomination. The Democrats\u2019 argument was instead directed at both their base and their caucus to provide a clear rationale for opposing the nominee \u2015 no matter his qualifications. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) made this point abundantly clear when he pointed to the series of 5-4 decisions made under Roberts\u2019 leadership that have changed laws to help Republicans get elected, big donors gain more influence in politics through campaign contributions and corporations gain more economic and political power. \u201cI think these 5-4 decisions are a problem, you said sometimes \u2015 I think I\u2019m quoting you correctly \u2015 sometimes big corporations can capture an agency,\u201d Whitehouse said to Gorsuch. \u201cThat\u2019s a well known principle of administrative law and of economics. Just let\u2019s be sure that our Supreme Court doesn\u2019t get to be one of those agencies that\u2019s captured on any subject.\u201d On this week\u2019s episode of The Huffington Post\u2019s \u201cSo That Happened\u201d podcast, 2016 Democratic House candidate Zephyr Teachout, a constitutional law professor at Fordham University School of Law, said the Democrats took the right approach by aiming their fire at the court as an institution that shapes our economy and our politics. \u201cI thought both Whitehouse and others rightly pointed out that after Roberts\u2019 confirmation we gotta pull away that fake story that you\u2019re just calling balls and strikes,\u201d Teachout said. \u201cWe know, and we know and have seen, that the Supreme Court reshapes power in our country.\u201d Gorsuch, who worked on former President George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 reelection campaign and as a lawyer in his Justice Department, provided the expected performance past court nominees had given during his appearance; he stated that he would be shocked by politics coming into a courtroom. \u201cI\u2019m distressed to hear you think that judges of the Supreme Court is an organ of a party,\u201d Gorsuch told Whitehouse. It is no surprise that Democrats find little need to take this opinion seriously anymore. Former President Barack Obama had nominated Judge Merrick Garland to fill Scalia\u2019s seat practically one year to the date before Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation hearing. Senate Republicans refused to hold public hearings for Garland and declined to meet with him in private. Gorsuch\u2019s nomination represents the fruit of the Republicans\u2019 decision to block Garland. Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) called this \u201can extraordinary blockade.\u201d \u201cIt was totally unprecedented in our country\u2019s whole history,\u201d he added. \u201cSome likened it to the action of the tyrannical kings who claim that they have sole control, as one of our senators referred to here a few minutes ago.\u201d Responding to Gorsuch\u2019s stated belief that justices have no partisan leanings, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) explained, \u201cAnd you know, you said earlier, there are no Democratic judges, there are no Republican judges. If that\u2019s the case, what was Merrick Garland about? That\u2019s what it was about.\u201d In addition, Democrats are still irritated at Roberts for promising to call only \u201cballs and strikes\u201d in his 2005 confirmation hearing. Instead, he went on to anchor the five vote conservative majority\u2019s decisions in controversial cases. These included Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which opened the door to unlimited corporate spending in politics; Shelby County v. Holder, which overturned a key section of the voting rights act; and numerous pro-corporate decisions limiting the rights of citizens to challenge corporations in courts, reducing the ability of states to protect patient and privacy and allowing mutual funds to lie to investors. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) blasted Roberts\u2019 decision in Shelby County for creating a whole new constitutional doctrine out of whole cloth, \u201cSo, so much for judicial modesty,\u201d she said. \u201cSo much for balls and strikes. So much for judges judge best when they judge least, which you mentioned tonight as a virtue.\u201d The Roberts Court has done much to reshape power in the United States. The five vote conservative majority that included Scalia has sided with corporations and corporate lobby groups more than any other Supreme Court majority in recent history. After Gorsuch repeatedly stated that there was ample room for Congress to legislate without worrying about court decisions, Democrats reminded him of how the court\u2019s decisions play a key role in shaping who is elected to Congress and, therefore, what bills can be passed in the first place. \u201c[B]y tilting the political playing field so heavily toward corporations and against individuals, hasn\u2019t the court impacted the composition of who is in Congress and made it therefore even harder for Congress to taking meaningful,\u201d Hirono said. \u201cMeaningful action to say past laws to protect worker safety or the access of students with special needs to an education?\u201d Whitehouse asked about the court\u2019s controversial Citizens United decision, \u201cWhat could be more involved in politics than to open this ocean of dark money that\u2019s flooded into our politics?\u201d Democrats on the committee appeared frustrated that Gorsuch refused to acknowledge the court\u2019s role in transforming both the political and economic worlds the country\u2019s citizens operate in. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told Politico that Gorsuch \u201cdid not win anybody over with his testimony.\u201d Schumer added that he believed he had the 41 votes necessary to filibuster the nomination.",

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee went so far as to say Obama should \u201cstep down\u201d for not using the term and Clinton should \u201cget out of this race\u201d if she won\u2019t either. \u201cIf we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cBecause our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen -- and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct anymore.\u201d Obama, speaking from the White House on Sunday, said the nightclub massacre in which 50 people were killed and at least 53 others were wounded is being investigated as an \u201cact of terror,\u201d though did not say whether it was tied to radical Islam. The gunman, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, was heard shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d while engaging officers, law enforcement sources told Fox News. Mateen also called 911 during the shooting to pledge allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Fox News has learned. ISIS reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack, though it\u2019s unclear if the shooting was actually directed by the group or only inspired by it. All these details, surrounding the deadliest terror attack on the U.S. homeland since 9/11, have fueled tensions in the presidential race at an already-combustible time. Trump has faced intense criticism from members of both parties for his calls to temporarily ban Muslim immigration to the U.S. In the wake of the Orlando attack, Trump again defended his proposals, saying on Twitter: \u201cWhat has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough.\u201d Trump originally was planning to deliver a speech Monday in Manchester, N.H., focused on the Clintons. In the wake of the Orlando attack, it will also focus on security and immigration issues, Fox News is told. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders also condemned the attack, while speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington, Vt. Earlier Sunday, Clinton released a statement unequivocally calling the massacre an \u201cact of terror.\u201d \u201cFor now, we can say for certain that we need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad. That means defeating international terror groups, working with allies and partners to go after them wherever they are, countering their attempts to recruit people here and everywhere, and hardening our defenses at home. It also means refusing to be intimidated and staying true to our values,\u201d she said. She also called it an \u201cact of hate\u201d -- a term Obama also used -- since the attacker targeted an LGBT nightclub during Pride Month. And she said the country needs to \u201ckeep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals.\u201d Clinton did not reference radical Islam. Meanwhile, a joint campaign rally with Clinton and Obama set for Wednesday in Green Bay, Wis., has been postponed in light of the attack, according to a White House official. Obama also ordered U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff \u201cas a mark of respect for the victims of the act of hatred and terror perpetrated on Sunday, June 12, 2016, in Orlando, Florida.\u201d Florida GOP Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency, which will make additional resources available for local authorities.

Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) appeared unreceptive to the question of an anonymous reporter this weekend, when he grabbed the self-identified \u201cstudent\u201d after he asked the congressman if he \u201cfully supported the Obama agenda.\u201d In the video, the North Carolina lawmaker is seen approaching the camera, while the reporter asks, \u201cHi, Congressman. How are you? Do you fully support the Obama agenda?\u201d Etheridge appears visibly irritated and immediately asks, \u201cwho are you?\u201d before knocking the interviewer\u2019s camera to the ground.

The cameraman replies, \u201cwe\u2019re just here for a project...we\u2019re just students.\u201d Over at Big Government, a post accompanying the video provides the following commentary on the encounter: \u201cExpect more of this. A hard, progressive left captured the Democrat majority in Congress and forced them to enact a fantasy grab-bag of legislation that is increasingly unpopular with the American public. We\u2019re on the cusp of a deeper recession, millions of unemployed Americans have no prospect for work, taxes are about to spike higher and we\u2019ve maxed out the national credit card. The Democrats were given a chance to run government and they\u2019ve only succeeded in running it into the ground. [...] Let\u2019s recap what we saw on this video. A sitting Congressman-a presumed living extension of James Madison and other founding fathers-was asked on a public street whether he supported the President\u2019s agenda. His response was to hit away a video camera and assault a student. The age of Pericles this ain\u2019t. It is going to be a long, hot summer. But, you\u2019ve been given a target. Act accordingly.\u201d Mediaite, in a response to the Big Government post, writes about the problems with anonymous inflammatory assault interviews, and argues that it might be this new brand of \u201cjournalism\u201d that has Etheridge on edge: \u201cNow, Etheridge\u2019s actions are only partially defensible. He need not have gotten physical with the students who asked him the provocative question regarding his support of the \u201cObama Agenda\u201d (honestly, that sort of opening question is straight from the Jason Mattera school of inflammatory interview techniques.) But little is known about these \u201cstudents.\u201d The YouTube video is published under an account titled TonyManization, and even more damning is that the faces of the individuals asking the Congressman questions are blurred out. Hmmm...nothing like the courage of the anonymous protester. Which brings us back to Etheridge\u2019s response. Yeah - he comes off as a jerk, but...when in Rome. It will be interesting to follow how this story plays out in the news media. Will it be a big story? Probably not, but apparently being prepared for ambush interviews from eager college kids is the next phase of media training for many on Capitol Hill.\u201d UPDATE: DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse addressed the video in a statement Monday: \u201cMotives matter, and I think you can see who was behind this,\u201d Woodhouse said. \u201cThis was a Republican party tracking operation. If it wasn\u2019t a party tracker or intern, why is the face blurred and why is the source hidden? You know if it had been a right wing blog, they\u2019d identify themselves and they\u2019d be booking this person on TV all day. Republicans know if they admit their involvement in this game of gotcha it will undermine their credibility. One minute this guy is interviewing a member of Congress on camera and the next a video is released with his face blurred out?

On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) received a letter signed by all 42 Senate Republicans, which stated, \"[W]e write to inform you that we will not agree to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to any legislative item until the Senate has acted to fund the government and we have prevented the tax increase that is currently awaiting all American taxpayers.\" But Reid plans to file cloture this week on at least three measures: the DREAM Act, collective bargaining for firefighters, and a 9/11 health bill. A senior Democratic staffer told The Huffington Post that it was likely to happen tonight or tomorrow. If it happens tonight, any of the bills could come before the Senate for a vote on proceeding to full debate as soon as Friday or possibly early next week. \"It had been my intention to file cloture on both of these bills last evening,\" said Reid on the Senate floor on Tuesday, \"however, supporters of the original bills requested that some modifications be made. These changes are reflected in the bills. I intend to move forward on both of these pieces of legislation. In addition, I intend to file cloture this week on the 9/11 health bill. I'll file cloture on all three of these at the same time.\" \"We already have things on the calendar,\" said the Democratic staffer, noting that right now, it doesn't appear as if tax cuts will come before these measures that are already in the queue. There could be some cracks in the GOP coalition to stand firm against any non-budget or tax cuts legislation though. Sen. Susan Collins' (R-Maine) is reportedly open to voting to proceed on repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell, even if the other issues aren't yet resolved. Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) recently introduced a compromise bill on extending unemployment benefits. There's no indication yet that it will make it to the floor anytime soon, but if it did come up before a vote on the Bush tax cuts, it would put Brown in the tough spot of voting against his legislation or breaking with his party.

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court appeared closely divided on Tuesday during arguments over the theory put forth by the plaintiffs in an enormous sex discrimination class-action case against Wal-Mart. Even some justices who seemed sympathetic to the plaintiffs expressed qualms about how to administer a lawsuit involving as many as 1.5 million women seeking back pay that could amount to billions of dollars. Others appeared worried about the consequences for other businesses of a ruling that would allow the case against Wal-Mart to go forward. The mere certification of a class-action suit can prompt defendants to settle in light of the sums at stake, and the justices struggled to find a way to distinguish between gaps in pay that might have benign explanations and those caused by unlawful discrimination. The court of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has recently issued a series of rulings in favor of plaintiffs suing for employment discrimination that cut against the court\u2019s pro-business reputation. The Wal-Mart case dwarfs those rulings in importance. It is the largest employment discrimination class action in history, and the court\u2019s decision, expected by June, will probably be its most important business ruling this term. The issue before the justices at Tuesday\u2019s arguments was not whether Wal-Mart, the country\u2019s largest retailer and biggest private employer, discriminated against women who worked there. For now, the question in the case, Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, No. 10-277, is whether hundreds of thousands of female workers have enough in common to join together in a single lawsuit. The plaintiffs\u2019 theory is that a centralized companywide policy gave local managers too much discretion in pay and promotion decisions, leaving Wal-Mart vulnerable to gender stereotypes. The plaintiffs have presented sworn statements and statistics to support their claim. Wal-Mart calls that evidence unrepresentative and unreliable. The company says its policies expressly bar discrimination and promote diversity. In any event, the company says, the plaintiffs \u2014 who worked in 3,400 stores in 170 job classifications \u2014 do not have enough in common to warrant class-action treatment. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the theory about how the company discriminated \u2014 through a central policy conferring local discretion \u2014 was internally inconsistent. \u201cYour complaint faces in two directions,\u201d he told a lawyer for the plaintiffs. But Justice Stephen G. Breyer said Wal-Mart could be held accountable if it failed to take action in the face of reports of discrimination from its stores. \u201cShould central management under the law have withdrawn some of the subjective discretion in order to stop these results?\u201d Justice Breyer asked. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed, saying that companies had a responsibility to make sure that women were treated fairly in local workplaces. And Justice Elena Kagan said that \u201cexcessive subjectivity\u201d may be a policy that violates the civil rights laws. But Justice Antonin Scalia was unconvinced. \u201cI\u2019m getting whipsawed here,\u201d he told the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, Joseph M. Sellers. \u201cOn the one hand, you say the problem is that they were utterly subjective, and on the other hand you say there is strong corporate culture that guides all of this. Well, which is it?\u201d Mr. Sellers responded that \u201cthere is this broad discretion given the managers\u201d but that \u201cthey do not make their decisions in a vacuum.\u201d Managers, he went on, \u201care informed by the company about how to exercise that discretion.\u201d That did not satisfy Justice Scalia. \u201cIf somebody tells you how to exercise discretion,\u201d he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t have discretion.\u201d Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for Wal-Mart, said the handful of women named as plaintiffs who seek to represent the entire class did not have typical experiences at the company. \u201cEach of the plaintiffs have very different stories,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of them was promoted into a managerial position. One was terminated for disciplinary violations. One was promoted and then had a disciplinary problem and then was demoted.\u201d He added that \u201cthis class includes at least 544 store managers who are alleged to be discriminators and victims.\u201d Several justices had practical concerns. \u201cWhat seems to me a very serious problem in this case is, how do you work out the back pay?\u201d Justice Ginsburg asked. Mr. Sellers said the trial court could rely on statistics culled from company databases, which he said were more reliable than the evidence that might be presented in individualized hearings given the available information about particular pay and promotion decisions. Memories have faded, he said, and Wal-Mart did not keep good records. Given that, Mr. Sellers said, Wal-Mart\u2019s personnel decisions were \u201cstandardless\u201d and \u201crecordless.\u201d Justice Kennedy responded with a point about the suitability of the case for class-action treatment. \u201cIf it\u2019s standardless and recordless,\u201d he said, \u201cthen why is there commonality?\u201d Mr. Boutrous said Mr. Sellers was trying to have it both ways. \u201cThe problem here, Mr. Sellers says, is that the records are not available,\u201d Mr. Boutrous said. \u201cThen he says we\u2019re going to have a proceeding where the district judge relies only on the records that he says are inadequate, to allow a reconstruction of the decision. That is not a process known to our jurisprudence. It doesn\u2019t comport with due process. Several justices voiced concerns about how many companies could be subject to class-action suits if they allowed the case against Wal-Mart to go forward. \u201cIs it true,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts asked Mr. Sellers, \u201cthat Wal-Mart\u2019s pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?\u201d Mr. Sellers said that was not the appropriate comparison. \u201cThe comparison that\u2019s relevant,\u201d he said, \u201cis between men and women and Wal-Mart.\u201d He added later that \u201cWal-Mart was behind the other large retailers.\u201d The chief justice also asked Mr. Sellers \u201chow many examples of abuse of the subjective discrimination delegation need to be shown before you can say that flows from the policy rather than from bad actors?\u201d After all, he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have some bad apples\u201d given Wal-Mart\u2019s thousands of stores. Mr. Sellers responded that \u201cthere is no minimum number\u201d in court decisions. Justices Kennedy and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they were concerned about companies whose pay and promotion gaps mirror national numbers where there is no proof of a discriminatory policy. \u201cSo, you have the company that is absolutely typical of the entire American work force,\u201d Justice Alito said. \u201cThen you would say every single company is in violation of Title VII\u201d of the Civil Rights Act? \u201cThat could very well be the case,\u201d Mr. Sellers said.",

        "body": " Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, has been excoriated by some Roman Catholic leaders ever since he claimed this month that his budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, was inspired by the moral teachings of his Catholic faith. The latest criticism comes in a letter released Tuesday and signed by nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown, the Jesuit university in Washington, in advance of Mr. Ryan\u2019s visit there on Thursday. Mr. Ryan is to deliver the prestigious Whittington Lecture, named for an associate dean who was killed on the airplane that crashed into the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001. The letter says, \u201cWe would be remiss in our duty to you and our students if we did not challenge your continuing misuse of Catholic teaching to defend a budget plan that decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few.\u201d \u201cYour budget appears to reflect the values of your favorite philosopher, Ayn Rand, rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ,\u201d says the letter, which the faculty members sent to Mr. Ryan along with a copy of the Vatican\u2019s Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church \u2014 \u201cto help deepen your understanding of Catholic social teaching.\u201d The pressure on Mr. Ryan is part of an effort by some Catholic leaders who are political independents, liberals and Democrats to make it clear that the Catholic church is not an arm of the Republican Party. In the last year, Catholic bishops have emerged as vocal critics of the Obama administration over what they regard as violations of religious freedom, in particular the mandate that even religious employers must provide health insurance that covers birth control. Their condemnation has grown so heated that this month, Bishop Daniel Jenky, of Peoria, Ill., said in a homily that President Obama was so intolerant of religion that he was \u201cfollowing a similar path\u201d as Hitler and Stalin. Dozens of faculty members at Notre Dame, also a Catholic university, sent a letter to the president and chairman of the board of trustees last Friday asking them to rebuke Bishop Jenky\u2019s comments and seek his resignation from the board. Bishop Jenky has stood by his comments. The budget authored by Mr. Ryan, a rising star among conservatives, has given Catholic leaders an opportunity to distance the church from the Republican Party. In an interview this month on the Christian Broadcasting Network, Mr. Ryan claimed that his budget was consistent with Catholic moral teaching because it pushes the poor to become independent of government assistance. \u201cThe preferential option for the poor, which is one of the primary tenants of Catholic social teaching, means don\u2019t keep people poor, don\u2019t make people dependent on government so that they stay stuck at their station in life, help people get out of poverty out onto life of independence,\u201d he said. The letter released Tuesday by the faculty at Georgetown took Mr. Ryan to task for that argument, saying that Catholic teaching calls for government to step in and help when communities \u201cface problems beyond their means to address, such as economic crises, high unemployment, endemic poverty and hunger.\u201d The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also issued several letters to members of Congress calling for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. Mr. Ryan claimed in a recent interview that those letters did not speak for all bishops, but the conference responded that those letters do indeed represent the bishops\u2019 collective opinion.",

        "body": " FERGUSON, Mo. -- Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that the \u201ceyes of the nation and the world\u201d are on this small suburb of St. Louis where an unarmed teenager was shot and killed by police earlier this month. The issues raised by Michael Brown's death, Holder said, have simmered \u201cbeneath the surface in more communities than just Ferguson.\u201d On Thursday, he told reporters in Washington that the Justice Department would thoroughly investigate the case, and would \"continue to stand with Ferguson.\" He also said that \"few things have affected me as greatly as my trip to Ferguson.\" Before a larger meeting at St. Louis Community College\u2013Florissant Valley on Wednesday, the attorney general met with several students at the local school in what he described as an \u201copportunity to sit down with some wonderful young people and to hear them talk about the mistrust they have at a young age.\u201d Dominique McCoy, who attended the smaller meeting, told The Huffington Post that Holder said change wouldn't happen overnight. \"He just let us speak, basically. He semi-voiced his opinion, but we all did the talking. He agreed somewhat to what everyone said,\u201d McCoy added. A separate attendee, Molyrik Welch, noted to another reporter that her brother had died following an encounter with Ferguson police in 2011. Holder told the students he understands \"the mistrust\" between some residents and the police. \u201cI am the attorney general of the United States, but I am also a black man,\" Holder said. Holder told others at the community college how he had been stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike and accused of speeding twice in the past, with police searching his car. \"I remember how humiliating that was and how angry I was and the impact it had on me,\" Holder said. \"The same kid who got stopped on the New Jersey freeway is now the attorney general of the United States,\" Holder added. \"This country is capable of change. But change doesn't happen by itself.\" After the college events, Holder headed over to Drake's Place restaurant in Ferguson to talk with other community members. Some people were told that they would be meeting with an official from the Justice Department, but not that it was Holder. The owners of the restaurant said they were informed of the event only about an hour ahead of time. The Justice Department\u2019s Community Relations Service had arranged for the gatherings. Holder was greeted as a star at Drake's Place, posing for selfies and group photos with residents and shaking hands. He settled into a corner booth as residents explained the problems that need to be rectified. Soon, Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, who has earned some praise since he took over policing of Ferguson's nightly protests, stopped by to greet the attorney general. \u201cMy man! You are the man,\u201d Holder said as Johnson walked in. After the meeting, attendees said they were thankful that Holder and the federal government were paying attention to Ferguson\u2019s problems. \u201cHe told me that he was here because he was concerned about everything that was going on and he wanted us to voice our opinions and what did we want to change, and that he was going back to the White House to report so we can get some funding, so we can get a game plan on how to help our community,\u201d Angela Whitman told HuffPost. Yvette Townsend-Saunders called the meeting \u201cwonderful\u201d and said she was thankful that Holder had come to the town. \u201cHe said that there needs to be some changes made, things need to be looked into and investigated,\u201d Townsend-Saunders said. \u201cWhen you were a little boy and you didn\u2019t do something well at school, your mother had to jump in. When the teacher didn\u2019t do something right, the principal had to jump in. I think if you do something right from the bottom, the top doesn\u2019t have to jump in. If things were done right in the beginning, all this wouldn\u2019t have to be.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t know it was Eric Holder [coming],\u201d Rev. John Paul Hopping of Our Lady of Guadalupe, told HuffPost. \u201cThey were really nice and they were really listening. They\u2019re looking for solutions and they want to help.\u201d At the community college, Holder said that they were starting \u201ca good dialogue\u201d but that it was \u201cnot enough.\u201d \u201cWe need concrete action to change things in this country,\u201d he said, according to excerpts provided by the Justice Department. \"This dialogue is important. But it can't simply be that we have a conversation that begins based on what happened on August 9 and ends sometime in December, and nothing happens. As I was just telling these young people, change is possible. The same kid who got stopped on the New Jersey freeway is now the attorney general of the United States. This country is capable of change. But change doesn't happen by itself.\u201d In addition to Ferguson community members, Holder spent Wednesday meeting with officials from the St. Louis-based U.S. attorney's office and the local FBI office investigating Brown's death. He is talking with Brown's parents and with members of the local congressional delegation.",

        "body": " Joe Biden knew Lloyd Bentsen. Lloyd Bentsen was a friend of Joe Biden\u2019s. And the vice president made full use of his old Senate colleague\u2019s 1988 debate playbook, shaking his head and scoffing pityingly at Representative Paul D. Ryan, trying to paint his opponent as a latter-day Dan Quayle. Mr. Ryan was no Dan Quayle, but he did make the mistake of mentioning John F. Kennedy in an argument over whether tax cuts recharge the economy. Mr. Biden flashed a Cheshire Cat grin and said to Ryan, after waiting a beat to let the moment sink in, \u201cSo, now you\u2019re Jack Kennedy?\u201d The vice presidential debate on Tuesday was supposed to be a reboot for the Obama campaign after the president\u2019s dismal performance at his debate with the Republican nominee for president, Mitt Romney, last week. Mr. Biden, clearly delighted to come to President Obama\u2019s rescue, relished his role, addressing his opponent as \u201cmy friend\u201d but dismissing his arguments as \u201cmalarkey.\u201d He laughed at Mr. Ryan\u2019s remarks so often and so heartily that at times he seemed like a guest at a comedy club roast, not a vice president debating the fate of the nation with his opponent. It was a sharp and spirited debate, with both candidates delivering some lacerating blows, but Mr. Ryan at times seemed disconcerted by the sheer blowhard intensity Mr. Biden brought to the night. Mr. Ryan tried to be respectful, listening to the vice president with a tilted head, choirboy smile and puppy-dog eyes, but he showed his irritation when Mr. Biden kept interrupting to attack his policy on Medicare. \u201cI know you\u2019re under duress,\u201d he told the vice president, prompting another belly laugh. For Mr. Biden especially, the night was his chance to relive past debates and unleash his inner barroom brawler. He had to be contained and courteous when he debated Sarah Palin four years ago, lest he look like a bully. This time he let loose. And unlike the courtly Mr. Bentsen in 1988, Mr. Biden turned his temperature up, singeing the young man across the table with patronizing grins, but mostly withering retorts. His interruptive barrage was as relentless as his silent mugging for the camera. Mr. Ryan held his own, but did look abashed when Mr. Biden mocked him for opposing the Obama stimulus, yet asking for government funds for his own district. \u201cOn two occasions, we \u2014 we \u2014 we advocated for constituents who were applying for grants,\u201d Mr. Ryan said stiffly. \u201cI love that. I love that,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThis was such a bad program, and he writes me a letter saying \u2014 writes the Department of Energy a letter saying, the reason we need this stimulus \u2014 it will create growth and jobs.\u201d When Mr. Biden went after Mr. Romney\u2019s infamous remark at a private fund-raiser about the \u201c47 percent,\u201d Mr. Ryan reminded the vice president of his own propensity for gaffes. \u201cI think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don\u2019t come out of your mouth the right way,\u201d he said with a gotcha smile. Mr. Biden was not quite as amused. Mr. Biden was not the only one in the room intent on rectifying his predecessor\u2019s mistakes. Martha Raddatz of ABC News was the moderator, and she made a point of speaking forcefully, pushing the candidates to be specific and changing subjects abruptly. She seemed determined to be less passive and sleepy than Jim Lehrer of PBS was as moderator of the Obama-Romney debate. Mr. Ryan made a point of praising Mr. Romney, even trying to soften his image by recounting a time when Mr. Romney gave money and attention to a couple whose children were badly injured in a car accident. It wasn\u2019t the best example to use, because it prompted Mr. Biden to describe his own tragedy, when his wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash. A version of this article appears in print on October 12, 2012, on page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Night of Withering Ripostes, Mostly Delivered by Biden.",

        "body": " President Obama\u2019s chief of staff used former President Bill Clinton as an intermediary to see if Representative Joe Sestak would drop out of Pennsylvania\u2019s Democratic Senate primary if given a prominent, but unpaid, advisory position, the White House said on Friday. Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff, asked Mr. Clinton last summer to explore \u201coptions of service\u201d on a presidential or senior government advisory board with Mr. Sestak, the White House said in a statement. Mr. Sestak said no and went on to win last week\u2019s primary against Senator Arlen Specter. The White House disputed Republican claims that the conversations might be illegal or improper. \u201cThere was no such impropriety,\u201d Robert F. Bauer, the White House counsel, said in a memo released to reporters. \u201cThe Democratic Party leadership had a legitimate interest in averting a divisive primary fight and a similarly legitimate concern about the congressman vacating his seat in the House.\u201d Mr. Bauer went on to say that such horse-trading has been commonplace through history. \u201cThere have been numerous, reported instances in the past when prior administrations \u2013 both Democratic and Republican, and motivated by the same goals \u2013 discussed alternative paths to service for qualified individuals also considering campaigns for public office,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuch discussions are fully consistent with the relevant law and ethical requirements.\u201d Representative Darrell Issa of California, the senior Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said the interactions described by the White House \u201crepresent an illegal quid pro quo,\u201d even if the position was unpaid. \u201cIt is abundantly clear that this kind of conduct is contrary to President Obama\u2019s pledge to change \u2019business as usual\u2019 and that his administration has engaged in the kind of political shenanigans he once campaigned to end.\u201d Federal law makes it a crime for anyone \u201cwho directly or indirectly, promises any employment, position, compensation, contract, appointment, or any other benefit\u201d to someone else \u201cas consideration, favor, or reward for any political activity or for the support of or opposition to any candidate or any political party in connection with any general or special election to any political office.\u201d It is also illegal for a government official to use \u201chis official authority for the purpose of interfering with, or affecting, the nomination or the election of any candidate\u201d for Senate. While many have speculated that the White House offered to appoint Mr. Sestak as secretary of the Navy, Mr. Bauer said that was never the case. The White House did not offer Mr. Sestak a full-time paid position because Mr. Emanuel wanted him to stay in the House rather than risk losing his seat, so he considered \u201cuncompensated advisory board options.\u201d The White House did not disclose what those options were, but people briefed on the matter said one option was an appointment to the president\u2019s Intelligence Advisory Board, a panel of prominent Americans outside government who provide independent oversight of the nation\u2019s spy apparatus and advise the president. But White House officials discovered that it would not work because Mr. Sestak could not serve on the board while still serving in Congress. In a statement Friday, Mr. Sestak said Mr. Clinton had conveyed Mr. Emanuel\u2019s suggestion that he join a \u201cpresidential board\u201d while remaining in the House, but he declined. \u201cI told President Clinton that my only consideration in getting into the Senate race or not was whether it was the right thing to do for Pennsylvania working families and not any offer,\u201d Mr. Sestak said. \u201cThe former president said he knew I\u2019d say that, and the conversation moved on to other subjects.\u201d Mr. Sestak first mentioned publicly in February that he had been offered a job but provided no details, and the White House for three months had refused to discuss it, generating intense criticism from Republicans who accused it of trying to bribe a congressman and deep consternation among Democrats who called on the administration to answer questions. Mr. Emanuel was eager last summer to clear the way to this year\u2019s Democratic Senate nomination for Mr. Specter, who had just left the Republican party, and to bolster Democrats\u2019 majority in the Senate. Mr. Sestak, a retired admiral and two-term House member, was already planning a run. In tapping Mr. Clinton as the go-between, Mr. Emanuel picked the party\u2019s most prominent figure other than Mr. Obama and someone Mr. Sestak had worked for on the National Security Council in the 1990s. Mr. Sestak endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton against Mr. Obama in the 2008 presidential primaries, and Mr. Clinton was one of the first to call to congratulate him on his Senate victory last week. Mr. Clinton was at the White House on Thursday to have lunch with Mr. Obama and join him in greeting the American men\u2019s World Cup soccer team heading to South Africa. As chief of staff and previously as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Mr. Emanuel has not been shy about trying to steer party nominations to those he considers the stronger candidates. The White House under Mr. Emanuel has also leaned on Gov. David Paterson of New York to drop out of this year\u2019s gubernatorial race, which he eventually did under a cloud of scandal. Mr. Emanuel\u2019s deputy, Jim Messina, suggested a possible administration job to Andrew Romanoff to get him to not challenge Sen. Michael Bennet in a Colorado primary, The Denver Post has reported, citing unnamed sources. Whether that constitutes ordinary political horse-trading or crosses a legal line has been debated in Washington for months. Democrats and some Republicans have said it is hardly unusual for presidents to offer political appointments to clear the way for allies. But Republicans have suggested such actions may constitute a crime. Mr. Issa and all seven Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have asked the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor. The Justice Department wrote Mr. Issa last week that it did not need a special prosecutor to investigate if it chose to do so. Government officials, who asked not to be identified discussing legal decisions, said that neither the Justice Department nor the Office of Special Counsel, an agency that looks at violations of the Hatch Act governing the political conduct of federal employees, is investigating. While declining to discuss what happened, Mr. Obama on Thursday said, \u201cI can assure the public that nothing improper took place.\u201d",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Peter Strzok, the F.B.I. senior counterintelligence agent who disparaged President Trump in inflammatory text messages and helped oversee the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations, has been fired for violating bureau policies, Mr. Strzok\u2019s lawyer said Monday. Mr. Trump and his allies seized on the texts \u2014 exchanged during the 2016 campaign with a former F.B.I. lawyer, Lisa Page \u2014 in assailing the Russia investigation as an illegitimate \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d  Mr. Strzok, who rose over 20 years at the F.B.I. to become one of its most experienced counterintelligence agents, was a key figure in the early months of the inquiry. Along with writing the texts, Mr. Strzok was accused of sending a highly sensitive search warrant to his personal email account. The F.B.I. had been under immense political pressure by Mr. Trump to dismiss Mr. Strzok, who was removed last summer from the staff of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.  The president has repeatedly denounced Mr. Strzok in posts on Twitter, and on Monday expressed satisfaction that he had been sacked. Mr. Trump\u2019s victory traces back to June, when Mr. Strzok\u2019s conduct was laid out in a wide-ranging inspector general\u2019s report on how the F.B.I. handled the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails in the run-up to the 2016 election.  The report was critical of Mr. Strzok\u2019s conduct in sending the texts, and the bureau\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility said that Mr. Strzok should be suspended for 60 days and demoted.  Mr. Strzok had testified before the House in July about how he had not allowed his political views to interfere with the investigations he was overseeing. But Mr. Strzok\u2019s lawyer said the deputy director of the F.B.I., David Bowdich, had overruled the Office of Professional Responsibility and fired Mr. Strzok. A spokeswoman for the F.B.I. did not respond to a message seeking comment about why Mr. Strzok was dismissed rather than demoted.  Firing Mr. Strzok, however, removes a favorite target of Mr. Trump from the ranks of the F.B.I. and gives Mr. Bowdich and the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, a chance to move beyond the president\u2019s ire. Aitan Goelman, Mr. Strzok\u2019s lawyer, denounced his client\u2019s dismissal.  \u201cThe decision to fire Special Agent Strzok is not only a departure from typical bureau practice, but also contradicts Director Wray\u2019s testimony to Congress and his assurances that the F.B.I. intended to follow its regular process in this and all personnel matters,\u201d Mr. Goelman said. \u201cThis decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans,\u201d Mr. Goelman added.  \u201cA lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzok\u2019s personal views ever affected his work.\u201d Mr. Strzok\u2019s text exchanges with Ms. Page demonstrated animosity toward Mr. Trump.  In one, Ms. Page asks: Trump is \u201cnot ever going to become president, right? Right?!\u201d  Mr. Strzok responds: \u201cNo. No he won\u2019t. We\u2019ll stop it.\u201d  The inspector general, who uncovered the messages, found no evidence that the pair imposed their political views on their investigative decisions but cited that exchange as \u201cnot only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate\u2019s electoral prospects.\u201d The report by the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, that preceded Mr. Strzok\u2019s firing not only criticized his conduct in sending the texts but also his use of personal email accounts to handle sensitive information.  In addition, the inspector general criticized Mr. Strzok\u2019s decision not to move swiftly to examine new emails related to the Clinton investigation just weeks before the 2016 election. Mr. Horowitz said in his report that he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the text messages.  Hundreds exchanged over months were found in which the pair disparaged Mr. Trump and, to a lesser extent, Mrs. Clinton, exchanged work gossip and bantered. On Twitter, Mr. Strzok said he was \u201cdeeply saddened by this decision,\u201d adding, \u201cIt has been an honor to serve my country and work with the fine men and women of the FBI.\u201d Mr. Strzok became emblematic of Mr. Trump\u2019s unfounded assertions that a so-called deep state of bureaucrats opposed to him was undermining his presidency.  Mr. Trump contended that Mr. Strzok targeted the president and accused Mr. Strzok of being \u201ctreasonous\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d  Mr. Strzok told lawmakers that he never leaked information about the Russia inquiry, which could have upended the election and hurt Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of becoming president. After Mr. Horowitz uncovered the texts, Mr. Mueller, who had by then taken over the investigation, removed Mr. Strzok from his team.  He was reassigned to the F.B.I.\u2019s human resources division.  Ms. Page, who had left Mr. Mueller\u2019s team before the discovery of the text messages, quit the F.B.I. in May. The inspector general\u2019s report also took issue with the reaction by Mr. Strzok and other F.B.I. officials to the discovery of possible new evidence in the Clinton investigation, known internally as Midyear Exam, in late September 2016 on a laptop that belonged to the disgraced politician Anthony D. Weiner, the husband of a top Clinton aide. At the time, Mr. Strzok was in the early stages of investigating whether any Trump associates had conspired with Russia\u2019s interference in the presidential election, and nearly a month passed before agents and analysts began to act on the emails found on Mr. Weiner\u2019s laptop.  Mr. Horowitz could not rule out that Mr. Strzok had slow-walked the examination of the new emails to help Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential bid. \u201cUnder these circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok\u2019s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias,\u201d he wrote. The delays were merely the \u201cresult of bureaucratic snafus,\u201d Mr. Strzok\u2019s lawyer wrote last month in USA Today. But the justifications for the delay were \u201cunpersuasive\u201d and had \u201cfar-reaching consequences,\u201d the inspector general said.  James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, has told investigators that if he had known about the emails earlier, it might have influenced his decision to alert Congress to their existence days before the election. In addition, the inspector general said that Mr. Strzok had forwarded a proposed search warrant to his personal email account.  The inspector general said the email, which included a draft of the search warrant affidavit, contained information that appeared to be under seal. In a heated congressional hearing last month, Mr. Strzok expressed \u201csignificant regret\u201d for the texts and rebutted the president\u2019s attacks on the Russia inquiry.  \u201cThis investigation is not politically motivated; it is not a witch hunt; it is not a hoax,\u201d he said. Mr. Strzok\u2019s dismissal was not unexpected.  He is the second senior F.B.I. agent to be fired as a result of the inspector general\u2019s investigation.  In March, Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy director, was fired after the inspector general repeatedly faulted him for misleading investigators. The firing was politically motivated, Mr. McCabe has said, as an effort to discredit him as a witness in the special counsel investigation. Both men were fired before they were eligible for their pension and health benefits. Mr. Strzok, 48, a graduate of Georgetown University, served as an officer in the Army before he joined the F.B.I.  He held several key positions in the F.B.I., eventually becoming a top deputy in the counterintelligence division. He handled many important espionage cases including one involving a former C.I.A. officer suspected of working for China and a group of Russian spies who had been working undercover in the United States.",

Bob Etheridge in a physical confrontation with a young man, the lawmaker said he is \"profoundly\" sorry for the tussle on a Washington street. Etheridge, a Democrat, is seen in an amateur video grabbing the wrist and neck of an unidentified young man after the man approached the congressman and asked if he supported the \"Obama agenda.\" \"No matter how partisan and no matter how difficult things get sometimes, that's no excuse for my response,\" he added, shortly after releasing a written statement in which he said he \"profoundly\" regrets the incident. The video, posted to YouTube last Friday, shows the man, who appears to be in his early 20s and who identifies himself as a student, approaching Etheridge on the sidewalk. Etheridge is then seen trying to snatch a cell phone camera out of the student's hands. He then grabs the man's wrist and refuses to let go. \"Who are you!\" the seven-term congressman demands. \"Tell me who you are ... I have a right to know who you are.\" Another man, not seen on camera, then tells Etheridge, \"We're just here for a project.\" When the man asks Etheridge to \"please let go of me,\" the congressman then grabs him by the neck. Etheridge told reporters that he hasn't apologized to the young men involved because \"I dont know who they are.\" \"I would if I knew who they were,\" he said. \"I've been spat at, pushed and threatened before but that's no excuse,\" he added, saying that the incident occurred after a \"long day.\" \"His conduct is unbecoming of a member of Congress. It's bad enough that he's joined Obama's assault on North Carolina jobs, but his physical assault on a college student goes beyond the pale.\" Mike Flynn, a conservative blogger for biggovernment.com, wrote that the confrontation occurred last week outside a fundraiser headlined by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The video, which was posted on YouTube by \"DCCameraGuy,\" does not reveal the identity of the men making the tape. Etheridge, who has represented North Carolina's 2nd Congressional District since 1997, is running for re-election against Republican Renee Ellmers, a registered nurse, in November. Political observers have predicted that the 68-year-old congressman will likely hold on to his seat. Etheridge, a member of the House Ways and Means and Budget committees, voted in favor of President Obama's health care overhaul legislation as well as the Democratic climate change bill known by opponents as cap-and-trade.

        "body": " WASHINGTON -- The nation's leading advocate for senior citizens says that it hasn't wavered in its opposition to cutting Social Security benefits, though a top official with the group said it is open to a discussion about raising the retirement age and other changes. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday morning that AARP, one of the most influential lobbying groups in Washington, was softening its opposition to cutting retirement benefits. AARP initially pushed back against the newspaper's story. \"Stay tuned -- our position has not changed on Social Security,\" an AARP spokeswoman said in an email to HuffPost. AARP legislative policy director David Certner said on CNN Friday that \"there was some miscommunication with the Wall Street Journal story.\" But then Certner acknowledged that AARP believes the program needs to be changed. \"Everybody knows we need to look at a package of different changes to Social Security to make it strong for the long term,\" he said. \"The reality is, we have more people older and who are living longer, so we need to make changes. Everybody recognizes that. And we're certainly willing to talk about a package of changes that will keep Social Security strong.\" He suggested raising the age at which retirees can receive full benefits -- currently, 66 years old -- would be on the table even though doing so represents \"a massive benefit cut for people.\" The 37 million-member lobbying powerhouse launched a national ad campaign Thursday warning members of Congress not to reduce benefits for recipients of Social Security and Medicare. Jonathan Cowan, president of centrist think tank Third Way, hailed AARP's apparent reversal, per the Journal story. \"Today marks a watershed moment in American politics,\" Cowan said. \"For decades, AARP has stood against any substantial changes to Social Security. Now that they have opened the door to reform, it is time for lawmakers to walk through it.\" Yet AARP reassured labor groups that it had not changed its position on Social Security, labor officials told HuffPost. \"The AARP has a history of division between the top folks and their base on these issues. The top folks like to be in the inside game,\" one union official said. \"But they are walking backwards now.\" The official said that he and other opponents of benefit cuts had been told that AARP's \"longstanding position\" hadn't changed, but there was some uncertainty about what that position actually is. If AARP is open to reducing benefits, it would be a major boost for Social Security reformers who say the program is too generous and therefore unaffordable. Social Security will start paying out more in benefits than it absorbs in taxes this year which will lead the retirement program's trust fund to become exhausted in 2036, according to the latest annual trustees report. After 2036, the program will only be able to pay 77 percent of promised benefits. By 2085, it will be able to pay 74 percent of promised benefits. As of April, 35 million seniors received Social Security retirement benefits averaging $1,179 a month, according to the program's latest monthly snapshot. Economists credit the program for drastically reducing poverty among the elderly since its creation in the 1930s. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive Washington think tank, estimates that Social Security keeps 13 million elderly Americans out of poverty. The Journal reported that AARP policy chief John Rother is pushing the organization to accept benefit cuts as part of a deal to make Social Security solvent. Rother's thinking, according to the paper, is that tax increases alone can't keep the program's $2.6 trillion trust fund from running out of money, so benefit cuts must be included as well. Social Security's retirement benefits are funded with taxes on incomes up to $106,800, known as the taxable earnings base. The base also effectively serves as a cap on benefits because they are calculated according to a worker's contributions over his or her lifetime. A September 2010 Congressional Research Service report found that lifting the cap, without also raising benefits, would make the program solvent for the foreseeable future. \"If all earnings were subject to the payroll tax, but the base was retained for benefit calculations, the Social Security Trust Funds would remain solvent for the next 75 years,\" said the report. \"There are dozens of ways modest tax increases on even just the very wealthiest Americans would restore Social Security to long-run actuarial balance, and there would be enough left over to increase benefits,\" said Nancy Altman, co-chair of Strengthen Social Security, a 300-member coalition of national and state organizations opposed to benefit cuts. The problem with plans to hike taxes is that they're politically unfeasible because of congressional Republicans' adamant opposition to any sort of tax increase, much less a tax increase not accompanied by a spending cut. President Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform drafted a plan that would tweak Social Security by increasing taxes and reducing benefits both. That proposal went nowhere. UPDATE: AARP CEO A. Barry Rand said in a statement, \"It has long been AARP's policy that Social Security should be strengthened to provide adequate benefits and that it is sufficiently financed to ensure solvency with a stable trust fund for the next 75 years.\" The statement does not deny that AARP is open to reducing benefits.",

The self-titled America's Toughest Sheriff, who famously re-instituted chain gangs in 1995 and has also been a major supporter of his state's controversial SB1070 immigration law, said that Perry has done more to combat illegal immigration along the U.S. border then any of the other candidates. \"I'm endorsing Rick Perry because we need a tough-on-crime president who will champion and fund full-time border security operations from Brownsville to San Diego,\" Arpaio said. \"Governor Perry has a superior border security record and plan to make our border and our nation safer.\" \"Sheriff Arpaio knows the struggle border states face as Washington politicians and bureaucrats fail time and again to properly secure our nation's southern boundary with Mexico,\" said Gov. Perry. \"I am honored to have Sheriff Arpaio's support for my presidential campaign and our shared goals of fighting border crime with more personnel, border fencing and surveillance. A secure border is vital to protecting America's national security, public safety and jobs.\" The endorsement from Arpaio could prove helpful to Perry who has faced criticism about his stance on immigration from the Right for his support of DREAM children. The illegal immigration issue has also been a hotbed for clashes between Perry and GOP presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. Romney has said that Perry provided a magnet for undocumented immigrants to settle in Texas by supporting a law that allows people who are in the country unlawfully to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates. \"You said I don't want to build a fence,\" Romney said. \"You talk about magnets -- you put in place a magnet.\" Perry has also said the federal government should extend work visas permitting undocumented immigrants to move freely between the U.S. and their home countries, but stressed that he still opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship. \"As president, I will secure the border within a year putting thousands more federal boots on the ground, strategic fencing and aerial resources to fight border crime and make our states and nation safer,\" Perry said.",

Rashida Tlaib on Saturday after the latter\u2019s expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic socialist lawmaker from New York, went on Twitter to weigh in, accusing the GOP of a having a double standard. \u201cRepublican hypocrisy at its finest: saying that Trump admitting to sexual assault on tape is just \u2018locker room talk,\u2019 but scandalizing themselves into faux-outrage when my sis says a curse word in a bar,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.  \u201cGOP lost entitlement to policing women\u2019s behavior a long time ago. Next.\u201d The lawmaker was apparently referring to a 2005 video that came to light ahead of the 2016 presidential election, in which Trump \u2013 talking to Billy Bush \u2013 made lewd comments about women. Trump issued an apology at the time and described the contents of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording as \u201clocker room banter.\u201d  He later released a followup video apology, insisting the remarks didn't \"reflect who I am.\u201d \u201cI said it, I was wrong, and I apologize,\" Trump said. On Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a vow to support Tlaib, D-Mich. \u201cI got your back @RashidaTlaib - the Bronx and Detroit ride together,\u201d she tweeted. Tlaib, who was sworn in as a new member of the 116th Congress on Thursday, was videotaped that night vowing to impeach the president -- shortly after she penned an op-ed for The Detroit Free Press outlining the case for impeachment. \u201cPeople love you and you win,\u201d the video showed Tlaib telling supporters.  \u201cAnd when your son looks at you and says: \u2018Momma, look you won. Bullies don\u2019t win.\u2019  And I said, \u2018Baby, they don\u2019t, because we\u2019re gonna go in there and we\u2019re gonna impeach the motherf***er.\u2019\u201d House Republicans fumed over the comments on Friday, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., prodding Speaker Nancy Pelosi to act. Yet Pelosi, D-Calif., downplayed Tlaib\u2019s remarks, expressing distaste for the language but suggesting that Trump\u2019s own language had started the heated rhetoric in Washington. \u201cI probably have a generational reaction to it,\u201d Pelosi said at an MSNBC town hall.  \u201cBut in any event, I\u2019m not in the censorship business.  I don\u2019t like that language, I wouldn\u2019t use that language.

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump and Democratic congressional leaders dug in Wednesday for a lengthy partial shutdown in a newly divided government after a White House meeting \u2014 the first in 22 days \u2014 could not break an impasse over Mr. Trump\u2019s demands for billions of dollars for a border wall. During the contentious meeting in the Situation Room, Mr. Trump made his case for a wall on the southwestern border and rejected Democrats\u2019 proposals for reopening the government while the two sides ironed out their differences. \u201cI would look foolish if I did that,\u201d Mr. Trump responded after Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, posed the question to him directly, according to three officials familiar with the meeting who described it on the condition of anonymity. He said that the wall was why he was elected, one of the officials said. Democrats were equally adamant, according to another official who was present for the discussion. Pressed by Vice President Mike Pence and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming minority leader, they refused to budge from their offer to devote $1.3 billion to border security. The official also insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said after the meeting that he had no intention of putting Democratic bills to reopen the government to a vote if Mr. Trump would not sign them. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that, somehow, in the coming days and weeks, we\u2019ll be able to reach an agreement,\u201d Mr. McConnell told reporters at the Capitol, offering an ominous timeline. The events underscored the personal and political crosscurrents standing in the way of any compromise between a president unwilling to lose face with his core supporters on his signature campaign promise and newly empowered Democrats \u2014 poised to assume control of the House on Thursday \u2014 who refuse to give ground on an issue that has come to symbolize Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies. With the partial government funding lapse dragging into its 12th day and affecting 800,000 federal employees, the confrontation in the Situation Room only served to highlight the depth of the divide. \u201cCould be a long time, or it could be quickly,\u201d Mr. Trump said of resolving the shutdown. \u201cIt\u2019s too important a subject to walk away from.\u201d Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who is in line to be elected speaker on Thursday, said: \u201cWe are asking the president to open up government. Why would he not do it?\u201d \u201cHe could not give a good answer,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. Mr. Trump tried creative ways to persuade the Democrats that they should support his wall. At one point, he said Ms. Pelosi should back it because she was \u201ca good Catholic\u201d and Vatican City is surrounded by a wall, according to one of the officials familiar with the discussion. In her first legislative act as speaker, Ms. Pelosi plans on Thursday to bring up two bills to reopen the government. One would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, providing a month to break the impasse over border security funding, and a second would provide money for the remaining shuttered agencies and departments through September. The homeland security measure would devote $1.3 billion to border security measures, such as enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing, but not the wall. Mr. Trump\u2019s rejection of those measures left the prospects of a resolution at their dimmest since the shutdown began on Dec. 22. It also highlighted the difficulty of the current situation, in which Democrats, Republicans and even some White House staff members have found themselves trying to anticipate what Mr. Trump will accept. The president asked the congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday to continue the talks, after Democrats had completed their leadership elections, according to an official who attended the meeting. A second official who attended said Mr. Trump\u2019s team believed it would be easier for Ms. Pelosi to negotiate once she was officially installed as speaker. Both insisted on anonymity to describe the private gathering. In a pair of evening tweets, Mr. Trump seemed to hold out hope of an agreement, writing: \u201cI remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let\u2019s get it done!\u201d But the path to such a deal is murky at best. Before he met congressional leaders on Wednesday, Mr. Trump publicly rejected a compromise that Mr. Pence floated privately with Democrats last month to stave off the government funding lapse, saying $2.5 billion in border security spending was insufficient. In the hours before a midnight deadline to avert a shutdown before Christmas, the vice president had broached that number, which his team has quietly continued to push in the days after parts of the government ran out of money. \u201cNo, not $2.5 billion, no \u2014 we\u2019re asking for $5.6\u201d billion, Mr. Trump said during a cabinet meeting, hours before the Situation Room briefing. His rejection of the figure seemed to confirm the concerns of Democratic leaders who had questioned whether they could trust senior White House officials to broker any compromise that could then be rejected by a president who has often shifted his position at the last moment, especially when it comes to immigration. The larger figure referred to the amount Mr. Trump has demanded for the wall, which the House endorsed in a vote last month, but which failed to garner even majority support in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to prevail. But inside the Situation Room later on Wednesday, the proposal resurfaced and Mr. Trump appeared open to it, according to one of the officials present, as Mr. Pence and Mr. McCarthy pressed Democrats to meet in the middle. Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said $1.3 billion was their highest bid. Wednesday\u2019s gathering in the Situation Room, a secure chamber in the basement of the White House where military operations are tracked and other sensitive discussions unfold, was a conscious effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to infuse a sense of national-security crisis into the immigration discussion. It was the president\u2019s first face-to-face meeting with Democratic leaders since a combative session last month when he said he would insist that any government spending bill include money for a border wall \u2014 and would proudly own the consequences if that meant a shutdown. But it quickly turned tense as Mr. Trump argued for his wall and called on Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, who appeared via teleconference from the border in San Diego to stress the need for it, according to two of the officials who were at the meeting. Mr. Schumer interjected, calling on Ms. Pelosi, who disputed Ms. Nielsen\u2019s statistics, two of the officials said. Ms. Pelosi then laid out the legislative proposals she planned to bring up on Thursday, detailing how the spending measures had all received broad bipartisan support either in committees or on the floor in the Republican-controlled Congress. The back and forth drew an angry response from the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cDemocrats in the room either don\u2019t care that there is a humanitarian crisis on the border or just prefer ignorance,\u201d Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement on Wednesday night. \u201cIt was incredibly disheartening that they don\u2019t want to know the facts when making policy.\u201d Yet hours before the meeting began, what was billed as a somber security briefing had already taken on the sharp tone of a political showdown, as Mr. Trump charged that Democrats were sacrificing border security for a partisan advantage in the 2020 elections. \u201cThe United States needs a physical barrier,\u201d the president said during the cabinet meeting, comparing the southern border to \u201ca sieve\u201d that allows criminals and drugs to enter the country and facilitates human trafficking. \u201cWalls work,\u201d he added, claiming inaccurately that former President Barack Obama has one \u201caround his compound\u201d in Washington. (Parts of Mr. Obama\u2019s home in the northwest section of the city are bordered by a low brick retaining wall, and others have iron or chain-link fencing.) Mr. Trump repeated his false claims about the border wall, including that Mexico was already paying for it, as he promised during his campaign, and that much of its construction had already been completed. Outside the White House, the search for a way out is getting more urgent. Some lawmakers have grown anxious about the shutdown\u2019s impact on their constituents, including federal workers who are not receiving pay while their agencies are denied funding. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post suggesting three ways out: Grant the president the $1.6 billion for border security that he requested, without wall funding, plus an additional $1 billion for security at ports of entry; approve a bipartisan bill linking wall funding with protection for young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children; or resurrect the 2013 comprehensive immigration overhaul that included huge increases in border security measures, sweeping changes to immigration law and a pathway to citizenship for the nation\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants. Incoming lawmakers vented new concerns about the shutdown\u2019s effect. \u201cThis morning I requested that my pay be withheld until the shutdown is over,\u201d Representative-elect Mikie Sherrill, Democrat of New Jersey, said Wednesday on Twitter, where she posted a letter to the chief administrative officer of the House making her request official. She noted that thousands of federal workers in her state were not receiving paychecks. \u201cI came here to govern, not engage in partisan politics at the expense of hardworking Americans,\u201d she said.",

Lerner announced her plans to plead the Fifth during her testimony in a letter from her lawyer, William Taylor III, to the committee. \"She has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take this course,\" the letter addressed to Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) reads, according to the Los Angeles Times. Since she will be pleading the Fifth, Taylor has asked the committee that she be excused from testifying. The letter from Taylor states that her testimony would \"have no purpose other than to embarrass or burden her.\" The Wednesday hearing would have been Lerner's first public appearance, and first under oath, since she apologized for the IRS' inappropriate targeting of conservative groups at a May 10 American Bar Association meeting. That apology was planned ahead of time by the IRS, and came in response to a planted question. Issa has issued a subpoena to compel Lerner to appear at the hearing. Lerner is a key figure in the unfolding IRS scandal. As director of the IRS exempt organizations unit, she is in charge of the division overseeing nonprofit organizations, which includes the Cincinnati office that was the source of the inappropriate targeting criteria. The criteria directed the IRS to conduct a more intensive review of applications for tax-exempt status from groups with the name \"tea party\" or \"patriot.\" According to the report issued by the Department of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Lerner had to correct the criteria developed by the Cincinnati office twice because she and other top IRS officials found that they were using politically fraught terms as they sought to make sure groups were properly applying for tax exemption. Lerner's decision to plead the Fifth comes as the Department of Justice has initiated an investigation into whether laws were broken at the IRS, according to Taylor's letter to the committee. It also follows a request to Lerner from the committee to provide information on why she gave \"false or misleading information\" to the committee on four previous occasions in 2012. \u201cThe Committee has been contacted by Ms. Lerner\u2019s lawyer who stated that his client intended to invoke her 5th amendment right and refuse to answer questions,\u201d Oversight and Government Reform Committee spokesman Ali Ahmad said in a statement. \u201cMs. Lerner remains under subpoena from Chairman Issa to appear at tomorrow\u2019s hearing \u2014 the Committee has a Constitutional obligation to conduct oversight.

In the tax returns, released late Friday afternoon, the documents show the Clintons have paid $43 million in federal taxes since 2007. They also donated $15 million to charity, and paid an additional $13.6 million in state taxes. The Clintons' effective federal tax rate for 2014 was 35.7 percent, while the effective tax rate for federal, state and local taxes was 45.8 percent.

        "body": " Democrats Say Trump Should Cancel Putin Meeting After Indictments WASHINGTON \u2014 Leading Democrats called Friday for President Trump to cancel his upcoming meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia after the Justice Department indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats\u2019 emails and computer networks during the 2016 presidential race. Top Republicans were mostly mute, though a handful \u2014 including Representative Ed Royce of California, the retiring chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who has brain cancer; and Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a frequent critic of Mr. Trump \u2014 urged the president to use the indictments to get tough with Mr. Putin when they meet on Monday in Helsinki, Finland. \u201cPresident Trump must be willing to confront Putin from a position of strength and demonstrate that there will be a serious price to pay for his ongoing aggression towards the United States and democracies around the world,\u201d Mr. McCain said in a statement. \u201cIf President Trump is not prepared to hold Putin accountable, the summit in Helsinki should not move forward.\u201d A grand jury indicted the officers on Friday, accusing them of conspiring to interfere with the outcome of the 2016 presidential election by hacking the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The indictment is part of an open investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, who is examining whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, and whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice. \u201cThese indictments are further proof of what everyone but the president seems to understand: President Putin is an adversary who interfered in our elections to help President Trump win,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said, adding that Mr. Trump should cancel the meeting \u201cuntil Russia takes demonstrable and transparent steps to prove that they won\u2019t interfere in future elections.\u201d A number of Democrats lined up behind Mr. Schumer. Some on the House Foreign Affairs Committee also called for Mr. Trump to cancel the Monday session, as did Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, stopped short of calling on Mr. Trump to cancel, but he said the president should insist that other Americans be present and should demand that Mr. Putin extradite those indicted. \u201cI would not trust the president alone with Putin without some other Americans in the administration in there,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the president to break with the normal practice and meet with the Russian president alone, I wouldn\u2019t trust what he says there.\u201d The charges were announced here on Friday by Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who made clear during a news conference that the Justice Department views the hacking not as an attack on one party, but as an attack against the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to avoid thinking politically, as Republicans or Democrats, and instead to think patriotically as Americans,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said. \u201cOur response must not depend on which side was victimized.\u201d Mr. Sasse echoed that sentiment. \u201cThe U.S. intelligence community knows that the Russian government attacked the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Sasse said. \u201cThis is not a Republican or a Democrat view \u2014 it is simply the reality. All patriotic Americans should understand that Putin is not America\u2019s friend, and he is not the president\u2019s buddy. We should stand united against Putin\u2019s past and planned future attacks against us.\u201d But with the exception of Mr. McCain, Republicans steered clear of discussing whether Mr. Trump should cancel Monday\u2019s meeting in Helsinki.

        "body": " Rep. Anthony Weiner, in an interview with Fox News, said Wednesday he's certain he did not send a lewd photo of somebody's bulging underwear to a college student via Twitter. But the congressman repeatedly declined to say whether the picture was an image of him. The congressman, who described the incident as \"mischief,\" continued to allege that he was the victim of a computer hacker. He said he's asked an Internet security firm and a law firm to take a \"hard look\" at the incident and find out what happened, though he suggested he doesn't want to make a federal case out of it. He said somebody is just trying to distract him. \"I know for a fact that my account was hacked,\" Weiner told Fox News. \"I can definitively say that I did not send this.\" He also said he \"certainly\" does not know the college student the image was sent to -- though, when asked repeatedly, Weiner declined to say whether he was shown in the image. The New York Democrat, who is known for his combative style in interviews and on the House floor, granted a series of TV interviews after getting testy with reporters late Tuesday. At the time, he repeatedly said he would not allow the incident to distract him from his job, as he likened what he described as a \"prank\" to somebody shouting out an insult or throwing a pie during a speech. Asked point-blank, \"Is that picture you?\" Weiner replied, \"You know I'm not going to talk about this anymore.\" \"This is the tactic. The guy in the back of the room who's throwing the pie or yelling out the insult wants that to be the conversation,\" Weiner told reporters. \"But I am not going to allow this thing to dominate what I talk about.\" As reporters continued to ask him for several minutes whether he sent the image, the exchange became heated. At one point, Weiner referred to a reporter in the scrum as a \"jackass.\" Weiner referred to prior statements his office had put out, indicating he was through talking about the matter. Though Weiner's office had earlier responded to media inquiries, a few details appear to be keeping the story alive. Weiner's office initially said the congressman's account was \"obviously hacked,\" but the representative has since taken to calling the incident a \"prank\" -- he used both terms Wednesday. The U.S. Capitol Police so far have not opened an investigation into the matter. A former Justice Department computer crimes prosecutor said it would not cost much to request an investigation from the FBI. The former official said if Weiner had called the FBI when the story broke, the public would already know where the Tweet originated. Though Weiner said the incident did not constitute a federal crime, the former official said multiple federal crimes would have been committed if somebody did hack into his account -- and it could lead to years behind bars. Amid the controversy, a Twitter official emailed security tips to members of Congress regarding their accounts. \"While we won't comment on individual accounts, news reports of the past few days are a good reminder of the importance of actively protecting your account credentials,\" Twitter's Adam Sharp wrote. He urged offices to use a \"strong password\" of at least 10 characters including numbers and symbols, be on the lookout for \"suspicious links,\" and refrain from giving out passwords to \"untrusted third-parties.\" The photo in question showed a close-up shot of a man's bulging underwear. It was deleted within minutes of being sent. Breitbart's BigGovernment.com first reported that it was tweeted to a Seattle woman, later identified as Gennette Cordova. Cordova is just one of 198 people that Weiner follows on Twitter, though he has nearly 50,000 followers. Porn star Ginger Lee tweeted last month that she received a direct message from Weiner, and several other attractive women say they've been surprised to get a \"follow\" or a message from the prominent Democrat. Those claims are all circumstantial, but it doesn't help his case should there ever actually be one. Weiner, 46, is married to Huma Abedin, an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",

Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., and his wife, Margaret, were indicted on charges of illegally converting $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses and filing false records, prosecutors announced Tuesday. In response, House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday evening that he would remove the congressman from all committee assignments for the time being, calling the charges against Hunter \u201cdeeply serious.\u201d Among the allegations named in the 48-page indictment included instances between 2009 and 2016 when Hunter and his wife used campaign funds to pay for family vacations to Italy and Hawaii, school tuition, dental work, and even domestic and international travel for almost a dozen relatives, according to a press release from the Southern District of California\u2019s U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. The indictment also alleged that the pair spent \u201ctens of thousands of dollars\u201d on items ranging from movie tickets, fast food, golf outings, groceries and home utilities. Fox News obtained a letter sent from Hunter's attorney, Gregory A. Vega, to U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein on Aug. 6 asking him to postpone the indictment. Vega contended that there was a \"rush to indict\" after a two-year grand jury investigation. Vega asserted the prosecution was \"politically motivated\" because of Hunter's early support of Donald Trump for president. He also claimed bias from prosecutors in the Southern District of California who supported Hillary Clinton's candidacy. The congressman's lawyers said in 2017 that Hunter and his wife repaid the campaign about $60,000. Prosecutors said Hunter and his wife \u201cmischaracterized\u201d the purchases in Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings to hide the illicit spending. \u201cFamily dental bills paid with campaign funds were characterized as a charitable contribution to \u2018Smiles for Life,\u2019\u201d the press release from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said as an example. Charges included conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States, wire fraud and falsifying records. Hunter, one of Trump\u2019s earliest supporters in the presidential race, allegedly was aware of what he and his wife were doing and continued to spend campaign funds on personal expenses despite multiple warnings from his campaign treasurer about \u201cquestionable purchases.\u201d \u201cAccording to the indictment, the Hunters knew that many of their desired purchases could be made only by using campaign funds, since they did not otherwise have sufficient personal funds to pay for their purchases,\u201d according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. U.S. Attorney Adam Braverman said Tuesday\u2019s indictment proved that \u201cno one is above the law.\u201d The pair is due to be arraigned in court on Thursday morning.",

        "body": " Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill sent to his desk a day earlier, in the face of criticism that it could allow businesses and others to discriminate based on sexual orientation. Hutchinson had initially said he planned to sign the bill but backed off as his state, overnight, became the new focal point of a nationwide backlash over such legislation. Indiana for days has faced similar criticism for a related religious freedom bill. During a press conference in the state capital of Little Rock, Hutchinson said he wants to strike the \"right balance.\" The governor, amid calls by critics to veto the bill, made clear he still supports the intent of the legislation -- which prohibits state and local governments from infringing upon someone's religious beliefs without a compelling interest. But he said he wants changes made so it more closely mirrors a 1993 federal law. \"I asked that changes be made in the legislation,\" Hutchinson said, urging state lawmakers to \"recall\" the bill -- or pass additional legislation -- to \"remedy\" the issue. The announcement reflects the intense debate in state capitals across the country where such legislation is being considered. Backers say the intent was to simply replicate the 1993 federal law and similar laws in place in 19 other states. But when Indiana passed a slightly more expansive version which critics said could allow discrimination by businesses, Indiana lawmakers and Gov. Mike Pence later vowed to \"clarify\" the language in response to complaints. Hutchinson, too, said the country is clearly split on how to balance religious traditions with non-discrimination. At its heart, he said, \"this bill is not really complicated.\" But he cited a \"generational gap.\" As evidence, the governor said even his own son had signed a petition urging him to veto the bill. Hutchinson's chief complaint was that some provisions do not \"precisely mirror\" the federal law, and he wants that addressed. He said he's also working on an executive order to address the issue of tolerance. Echoing the reaction to Indiana's law, Hutchinson has faced pressure from the state's top employers, including retail giant Wal-Mart, which complained that the measure was discriminatory and would stifle economic development. Little Rock's mayor, the city's Chamber of Commerce and Arkansas-based data services company Acxiom all urged the governor to reject the measure in recent days. The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights group, has run ads in Silicon Valley targeting technology firms Hutchinson hopes to attract to the state. Prior to the passage Tuesday of the Arkansas bill, the White House repeated its opposition to the Indiana law. \"This kind of public outcry ... is indicative of how this piece of legislation flies in the face of values that people all across America strongly support,\" said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. \"Governor Pence falsely tried to suggest the law is the same as the 1993 law. That is not true.\" Earnest also said the Indiana law was a \"significant expansion\" of current law.",

Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) pleaded guilty in a federal courtroom Wednesday morning to using campaign funds to purchase an array of personal items including Bruce Lee memorabilia, a $43,000 Rolex watch and a mink cashmere cape. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy before U.S. District Judge Robert L. Wilkins. His wife, Sandra Jackson, who resigned from her position on Chicago\u2019s city council, is expected to plead guilty to filing false tax returns before the same judge on Wednesday afternoon. Jackson, dressed in a blue tie, blue shirt and a blue suit, looked back in the direction of his father and wife several times during the hearing. At one point he appeared to mouth, \"I'm sorry.\" The former representative, who co-wrote a 1999 book with his father, Rev. Jesse Jackson, titled It's About the Money!: How You Can Get Out of Debt, Build Wealth, and Achieve Your Financial Dreams, was accused of spending $750,000 in campaign funds on personal items for himself and for his wife. Jackson said he was clearheaded and had not been under treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, though he did have a beer last night. He said he had never been more clear in his life, and had read the documents thoroughly and had understood the consequences of his actions. He acknowledged he \"used money that shouldn't have been used,\" calling the government's statement accurate and saying he had \"no interest in wasting the taxpayers' time or money.\" The judge set the sentencing for June 28 at 2 p.m. Jackson will be free to go after he surrenders his passport, and will be restricted to living in the D.C. or Chicago area. The former national co-chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, Jackson was first elected to office in 1995 and resigned from Congress last year amid a federal investigation and his treatment for bipolar disorder. In a statement issued by his lawyers on Friday after court records indicated he planned a guilty plea, Jackson said he had \u201cno excuses\u201d for his conduct and \u201cfully accept my responsibility for the improper decisions and mistakes I have made.\u201d UPDATE 2:52 p.m. -- Additional records disclosed Wednesday revealed that expenses charged by Jackson and his wife to his campaign included $4,272.78 on the Navigator of the Seas cruise, $2,306.08 at Walt Disney World, over $10,000 at Best Buy, over $300 at Build-A-Bear, $3,544.00 at Mariel's Boutique, and $5,687.75 on Martha's Vineyard Holistic Retreat.

        "body": " Site Mobile Navigation Governor Appoints Ex-Aide to Fill Kerry\u2019s Seat BOSTON \u2014 Gov. Deval Patrick on Wednesday appointed William Cowan, a Boston lawyer who is a longtime friend and former aide, to serve as an interim United States senator until voters chose a successor to John Kerry in a special election set for June 25. Mr. Cowan, 43, who is known as Mo, is a former partner in the politically connected law firm of Mintz Levin and will become Massachusetts\u2019 first black senator since Edward Brooke, a Republican, held the seat from 1966 to 1978. His appointment makes Mr. Cowan the second black member to be seated in the current Senate, after Tim Scott of South Carolina was appointed by Gov. Nikki R. Haley. Mr. Patrick had said he wanted to appoint someone who did not want to run for the seat later because that person would have to conduct a campaign while learning the ropes in the Senate, and would be unlikely to do either job well. At a packed news conference at the State House, Mr. Cowan said he would not seek the permanent office or use the appointment as a springboard later. \u201cThis is going to be a very short political career,\u201d he vowed. The clock is now ticking toward the special election. It promises to be another bruising campaign, with two Democratic congressmen likely to face off in a primary in April. The biggest question remaining in this drawn-out episode, which began last fall when Mr. Kerry\u2019s name surfaced as a possible successor to Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state, is whether former Senator Scott P. Brown, a Republican, will jump in. Mr. Brown has remained mum on the subject, and his camp has sent few signals about his intentions, but he may find the opportunity hard to resist. Polls show him beating Representative Edward J. Markey, the only Democrat who has officially declared his candidacy. Mr. Brown has high name recognition and money left over from his unsuccessful race last year against Elizabeth Warren. If he entered the race and won, Mr. Brown would be in the awkward position of becoming the junior senator to Ms. Warren, even though she has been in office only a few weeks. The Senate historian said that those who return to the Senate after leaving \u2014 like Dan Coats of Indiana and Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, for example \u2014 lose their seniority, although the distinction has little meaning beyond a way to refer to a state\u2019s senators in the formal oratory of the Senate floor. Still, it would be unusual for a state to have two senators who had run against each other, especially in a race that was particularly hard fought. The June 25 special election would be Mr. Brown\u2019s third statewide Senate race in three years, starting with his win in a special election in January 2010 to finish Senator Edward M. Kennedy\u2019s term. If he won, he would presumably run in 2014 for a full six-year term \u2014 or four statewide races in nearly five years. So far, the only Democrat in the race is Mr. Markey, 66, a liberal and dean of the state\u2019s Congressional delegation. Several Democrats, including Mr. Kerry, have closed ranks behind him in the hopes of discouraging anyone else from getting in and avoiding a bruising primary. But Representative Stephen F. Lynch, a conservative Democrat from South Boston, is expected to announce Thursday that he will challenge Mr. Markey. The primary would be held on April 30. The rough and tumble of the coming campaign seemed far away at Wednesday\u2019s news conference, which was attended by Mr. Cowan\u2019s wife, Stacey, and their two young sons. \u201cHe\u2019s cool,\u201d Lt. Gov. Timothy Murray said of Mr. Cowan. \u201cTom Brady, George Clooney, James Bond and the president have nothing on Mo.\u201d Mr. Cowan, who usually wears a bow tie but opted not to for this occasion, is a former chief of staff and chief legal counsel to Mr. Patrick, the state\u2019s first black governor. From 1997 to 2009, he practiced civil litigation as an associate and later a partner in the Boston office of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo. He also served as a special assistant district attorney in Middlesex County. He left the Patrick administration last year to return to the private sector, but said this brief detour to Washington was a sacrifice worth making because he wanted to give something back to the state that had given him so much. Mr. Cowan said at the news conference that he was proud to take the post, noting that his mother, who was home in North Carolina recovering from knee surgery, was a child of the segregated South and had not attended college. The death of Mr. Cowan\u2019s father at a young age left her to raise her children alone. Despite her hardships, he said, \u201cMy mother told me that days like this were possible.\u201d He seemed to be a quick study in the senatorial art of not answering questions definitively. Asked, for example, if he would vote for military cuts if they cost jobs in Massachusetts, he called for \u201ca balanced approach,\u201d with some cuts and some revenue growth. Mr. Patrick showed similar deftness, skirting a question about why he had not picked former Representative Barney Frank, who had asserted that he would have loved the interim appointment. Mr. Cowan said that he would be relying on Mr. Kerry\u2019s staff in Washington and in Massachusetts for guidance and that he intended to continue Mr. Kerry\u2019s work. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any daylight there at all,\u201d he said. Mr. Patrick, who has served as a mentor to Mr. Cowan, was asked whether he saw some of himself in Mr. Cowan. \u201cI\u2019m not that cool,\u201d the governor replied.",

Long lines were seen outside Chick-fil-A restaurants nationwide, and many customers documented their visits on social media sites and shared their reasons for eating at the chain. Many said they showed up because they agreed with the position of Chick-fil-A\u2019s president on same-sex marriage, while others said they wanted to support freedom of expression for business owners. As my colleagues Kim Severson and Robbie Brown report from Atlanta, where Chick-fil-A began in the 1940s, the president, Dan T. Cathy, made comments last month about the biblical arguments against homosexuality. This prompted calls to boycott Chick-fil-A that were supported by the mayors of Boston and Chicago, along with plans for a same-sex kiss-in at the restaurants on Friday. Last weekend, Mr. Huckabee used his television and radio programs, as well as Facebook, to help organize an appreciation day for Chick-fil-A on Wednesday. More than 650,000 people signed up to participate, and tens of thousands \u201cliked\u201d photos of packed restaurants that Mr. Huckabee posted on his Facebook page on Wednesday.

Mr. Huckabee noted in regular audio updates Wednesday that Chick-fil-A did not participate in organizing the event. And there were no tweets or photos about the appreciation day on the company\u2019s Facebook or Twitter accounts.

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court appears ready to block a massive sex discrimination lawsuit against Wal-Mart on behalf of up to 1.6 million women, and that could make it harder for other workers nationwide to bring class-action claims against large employers. The 10-year-old lawsuit, argued in lively exchanges at the court Tuesday, claims that Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest employer, favors men over women in pay and promotions. Billions of dollars are at stake if it is allowed to go forward. The case also could affect the future of other class-action lawsuits that pool modest individual claims into a single action that creates the potential for a large judgment and increases the pressure on businesses to settle. In Tuesday's arguments, several justices suggested they were troubled by the case and lower court decisions against Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart. Estimates of how many women could be included in the lawsuit run from 500,000 to 1.6 million. Justice Anthony Kennedy, often a key vote on the high court, said the women's argument points in apparently conflicting directions. \"You said this is a culture where Arkansas knows, the headquarters knows, everything that's going on,\" Kennedy said to Joseph Sellers, the women's lawyer. \"Then in the next breath, you say, well, now these supervisors have too much discretion. It seems to me there's an inconsistency there, and I'm just not sure what the unlawful policy is.\" Sellers said that lower courts had been persuaded by statistical and other evidence put forth so far in the lawsuit. He said Wal-Mart's strong corporate culture stereotypes women as less aggressive than men and that translates into individual pay and promotion decisions at the more than 4,300 Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores across the country. \"The decisions are informed by the values the company provides,\" Sellers said. Justice Antonin Scalia said he felt \"whipsawed\" by Sellers' description. \"Well, which is it?\" Scalia asked. Either individual managers are on their own, \"or else a strong corporate culture tells them what to do.\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that at this stage of the lawsuit, the issue is not proving discrimination but showing enough evidence to go forward. \"We're talking about getting a foot in the door,\" Ginsburg said, a standard she called not hard to meet. Ginsburg, who made her name as a lawyer by bringing discrimination claims, said it was possible that Wal-Mart could refute the claims at a trial. The court's other two female justices, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, and Justice Stephen Breyer also appeared inclined to allow the lawsuit to proceed. But several of their more conservative colleagues appeared to agree with Theodore Boutrous Jr., representing Wal-Mart, that even subjecting the company to a trial would be unfair. That split among the justices raised the prospect of an ideologically divided ruling by the court this summer. Boutrous said the class-action nature of the case deprives the company of its legal rights because it is being forced to defend the treatment of female employees regardless of the jobs they hold or where they work. \"There is absolutely no way there can be a fair process here,\" Boutrous said. He pointed to a group of at least 544 women who serve as store managers who \"are alleged to be both discriminators and victims.\" Two of the named plaintiffs, Christine Kwapnoski and Betty Dukes, attended the argument. Kwapnoski is an assistant manager at a Sam's Club in Concord, Calif. Dukes is a greeter at the Wal-Mart in Pittsburg, Calif. Their situations were discussed only briefly, with Boutrous noting how different they were as a way to argue they should not be dealt with in the same lawsuit. Business interests have lined up with Wal-Mart while civil rights, women's and consumer groups have sided with the women plaintiffs. Both sides have painted the case as extremely consequential. The business community has said that a ruling for the women would lead to a flood of class-action lawsuits based on vague evidence. Supporters of the women say that if the court sides with Wal-Mart, it could remove a valuable weapon for fighting all sorts of discrimination. David Sanford, who represents plaintiffs in other class-action cases, said after the arguments that the court seemed inclined to rule against the Wal-Mart women. Sanford said such a decision could \"have implications for class actions more generally, making it more difficult for women and minority groups to enjoy equality and fair treatment in the workplace.\" The Obama administration is not taking part in the case, although it was lobbied by both sides.",

In his video, flanked by an American flag and a Texas state flag, he added: \u201cYou know, I look forward to staying in touch with everyone. It\u2019s been an honor and a privilege to serve. Thank you so much. Please, stay in touch. I love y\u2019all. God bless you, God bless Texas, God bless America.\u201d Farenthold\u2019s resignation took effect Friday at 5 p.m. Eastern time. He promptly deleted his Twitter and Facebook profiles. Farenthold used $84,000 in taxpayer funds to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit his former communications director, Lauren Greene, had filed in 2014, Politico reported in December. Greene accused Farenthold of telling her he had \u201csexual fantasies\u201d and \u201cwet dreams\u201d about her, and then claimed she was fired after complaining to Farenthold. \u201cI had no idea how to run a congressional office,\u201d the four-term congressman said in December. \u201cAs a result, I allowed a workplace culture to take root in my office that was too permissive and decidedly unprofessional.\u201d Farenthold said after the reports broke that he would repay the $84,000 to the Treasury Department, but has not made good on that promise. A representative for his office told HuffPost in February that the congressman was waiting to see what changes lawmakers will add to the Congressional Accountability Act. \u201cHe is waiting on the advice of counsel to see what final bill is enacted,\u201d Bob Haueter, Farenthold\u2019s chief of staff, told HuffPost at the time. \u201cOnce the final bill is done and the law is changed and is complete and he can see that, he will make a determination of how he proceeds.\u201d In his resignation statement, Farenthold reflected on his time spent working to \u201cmake government more efficient and responsive, cut government spending, repeal Obamacare, protect life and reduce the debt.\u201d \u201cI would like to thank my staff both in Washington and Texas for all of their hard work on behalf of our constituents. I would also like to thank my family for their unwavering support and most importantly the people that elected me,\u201d he said.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2015 The House intelligence committee is preparing to issue subpoenas against Michael Flynn after the former national security adviser denied a request to voluntarily turn over documents related to the committee\u2019s Russia probe. Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, said on Wednesday that the committee is prepared to use \u201cwhatever compulsory process we need\u201d to obtain information from Flynn if he does not cooperate with the subpoenas. He added that the committee could issue additional subpoenas if other witnesses fail to cooperate, but did not name additional individuals. Citing the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Flynn\u2019s lawyer said on Monday that Flynn would not comply with subpoenas from the Senate intelligence committee, which is conducting its own parallel investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the election and whether it colluded with President Donald Trump\u2019s associates. The Senate committee responded with two additional subpoenas on Tuesday targeting Flynn\u2019s businesses. The House committee\u2019s subpoenas \u201cwill be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,\u201d Schiff told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. \u201cWe need to use whatever compulsory mechanism necessary to get the information he possesses \u2026 the Fifth Amendment right not to provide materials or documents is limited,\u201d he added. Schiff said he is \u201cskeptical\u201d that the committee would agree to grant Flynn immunity in the future in exchange for information. The committee is also looking for ways to obtain documentation of Trump\u2019s conversations with top intelligence and law enforcement officials involved in a separate federal Russia probe. Trump implied earlier this month that he had \u201ctapes\u201d of discussions with recently fired FBI Director James Comey that would be damaging to Comey. And the Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers to push back on the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation. \u201cThat could be further evidence of an attempt to interfere with the investigation,\u201d Schiff said of Trump\u2019s reported request to Coats and Rogers. He also referred to past reports that the White House asked allies on Capitol Hill to refute negative press stories about Trump associates\u2019 ties to Russia. \u201cIf all of this is part of a pattern by the White House of interference or worse, that\u2019s something that we have to find out about and it\u2019s something we have to stop,\u201d he said. Despite concerns about Trump interfering with ongoing investigations into his campaign, Schiff warned that it is premature for Democrats on Capitol Hill to push for impeachment. \u201cThere\u2019s a legal standard that needs to be met for impeachment and then there\u2019s a very practical standard that has to be met,\u201d Schiff said. Practically speaking, he continued, impeachment is only possible if Republican lawmakers and the general public believe Trump is unfit for office. \u201cIf the Republicans in Congress or people at large in the country feel this is simply a way to nullify an election that others didn\u2019t agree with, then you\u2019re not going to meet the practical standards necessary,\u201d Schiff said.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) met for nearly an hour on Thursday evening in their latest attempt to break the impasse on impending tax hikes and spending cuts. True to form, neither said much of anything about what was discussed. Shortly after the meeting ended, both camps put out identical, banal statements. \"The President and Speaker had a frank meeting in the Oval Office tonight,\" said the statements. \"It lasted approximately 50 minutes. There will be no further readout of the meeting, but lines of communication remain open.\" Boehner was back at the Capitol soon afterward, but said nothing new as he passed reporters eager for a readout. \u201cNice to see all of you,\u201d he said as he kept walking, CNN\u2019s Deirdre Walsh tweeted. Boehner is heading back to Ohio for the weekend. A handful of others attended the meeting. Timothy Geithner, the treasury secretary, and Rob Nabors, director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, joined Obama, a White House aide confirmed. Boehner\u2019s chief of staff, Mike Sommers, and his policy director, Brett Loper, were also in attendance. Thursday night\u2019s meeting marks the second time in a week the president and House speaker have met in person, and comes after at least two phone calls in recent days. The continued dialogue provides some rays of hope to a negotiating process that, in recent days, has shown very little progress. Boehner has refused to budge from his refusal to consider raising tax rates on top earners while arguing that heavy spending cuts are needed. The White House, in contrast, has accused House Republican leadership of being deliberately vague on cuts, while insisting that no deal will end up getting the president's signature without a raising of tax rates. With the year-end deadline for all rates to expire and $1 trillion in spending cuts to kick in, the prospect of actually failing to find agreement is coming into focus. A top Senate Democratic aide told the Huffington Post on Thursday that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) told his caucus that finalizing a deal by Christmas was now basically impossible. Boehner, meanwhile, told lawmakers earlier Thursday not to make plans for Christmas, signaling that there may not realistically be a final deal until the very end of the month. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney wouldn\u2019t say whether Obama is also bracing for dragged out negotiations \u201cI can\u2019t speculate about the time frame,\u201d Carney said at his daily briefing. \u201cWhat the president is interested in is working with Congress to achieve a deal that avoids the fiscal cliff and, beyond that, addresses our long-term fiscal challenges in a balanced way. He wants to makes sure, first and foremost, that the middle class does not have their taxes go up on January 1st.\u201d",

        "body": " AMHERST, N.H. \u2014 Gov. Rick Perry of Texas on Tuesday said he would back a federal policy \u201cto detain and to deport every illegal alien that we apprehend.\u201d Mr. Perry, in his most expansive comments about illegal immigration since last week\u2019s Republican presidential debate, was not suggesting any rounding up of illegal immigrants, an aide later made clear, but calling for all people arrested or detained \u2014 and later found to be undocumented \u2014 to be expelled from the country after an expedited hearing. The candidate sought to draw a contrast with the Obama administration, which he criticized as having a \u201ccatch-and-release\u201d policy that allows some nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the general public. It\u2019s a \u201chorrific policy,\u201d Mr. Perry said. Backers of the policy say it allows officials to focus resources on deporting illegal immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes or who are a threat to the public safety or the national interest. With a little more than a month to go before the New Hampshire primary, the Texas governor is trying to shore up his credentials on immigration: On Tuesday he won an endorsement from one of the nation\u2019s most outspoken and controversial public officials on that issue: Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Ariz., who unabashedly calls himself the \u201ctoughest sheriff\u201d in the country. Appearing at Joey\u2019s Diner here, in the southern end of the state, Mr. Arpaio, who had also been courted by Representative Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain, praised what he called Mr. Perry\u2019s efforts to interdict illegal crossings by sending Texas Rangers and other state law enforcement to the Texas border with Mexico. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t just talk about it; he does something about it,\u201d Mr. Arpaio said. Mr. Perry was widely criticized within his own party for backing a state plan that gives some children of illegal immigrants the same lower-cost in-state college tuition that is enjoyed by American citizens who attend the state\u2019s public universities and who have been Texas residents at least three years. At one point he suggested that those who opposed his position were heartless. On Tuesday he repeated his apology for that comment, calling it \u201cvery inappropriate,\u201d his latest effort to try to win back some Republican primary voters who abandoned him as rivals sought to paint him as too soft on illegal immigration. But it remains to be seen how much an endorsement from Sheriff Arpaio will help him in this state, where Mr. Perry is polling far behind the leader, Mitt Romney. According to one recent poll, immigration was cited by only 4 percent of likely Republican voters as the most important issue. Mr. Arpaio is also a polarizing figure. Last year, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the sheriff for not cooperating with an investigation into whether the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Department is systematically violating the rights of Hispanics. It was the first time in a generation, according to officials, that the federal government has filed suit to force a law enforcement agency to cooperate with such an investigation. The sheriff has called the Justice Department\u2019s action an attempt to intimidate him and he has said he does not engage in racial profiling. Mr. Arpaio, who gained wide notice for forcing inmates to wear pink underwear and housing them in tents, is popular in his state, where he has repeatedly won re-election by a sizable margin. Even so, there are signs that the state\u2019s aggressive immigration policies have begun to turn off some: Earlier this month a longtime Arpaio ally, Arizona State Sen. Russell Pearce, was defeated in a recall election by a more moderate Republican. Mr. Pearce had pushed through a controversial law last year that would have turned police officers throughout the state into de facto immigration agents. The Justice Department is fighting the law, which has not taken effect yet. On Tuesday, Mr. Perry signaled that he would not support the continuation of that lawsuit if he were elected president, saying that the federal government should not \u201cbe suing states for making decisions that they think\u201d are in the best interests of their citizens.",

I accept the fact that the president is a Christian,\" Santorum said. \"I was talking about the radical environmentalist,\" he said. \"I was talking about energy, this idea that man is here to serve the Earth as opposed to husband its resources and be good stewards of the Earth. And I think that is a phony ideal. \"I don't believe that that's what we're here to do. That man is here to use the resources and use them wisely, to care for the Earth, to be a steward of the Earth, but we're not here to serve the Earth. The Earth is not the objective. Man is the objective. And I think a lot of radical environmentalists have it upside down,\" Santorum said. But the president's campaign, responding forcefully to the new frontrunner in the GOP race, said the remark is a personal affront. \"I can't help but think that those remarks are well over the line. It's wrong. It's destructive,\" said Robert Gibbs, the president's former press secretary who is now working on Obama's reelection effort. \"It's time to get rid of this. It's time to have a debate on our political positions, but not question each other's character and faith,\" he said. Obama campaign deputy press secretary Ben Labolt also issued a statement Saturday shortly after Santorum told voters that Obama's agenda is \"not about you. It's not about your quality of life. It's not about your jobs. It's about some phony ideal. Some phony theology. Not a theology based on the Bible. A different theology.\" The comment was \"the latest low in a Republican primary campaign that has been fueled by distortions, ugliness, and searing pessimism and negativity.\" It was \"a stark contrast with the president who is focused everyday on creating jobs and restoring economic security for the middle class,\" LaBolt said. Santorum, who has pulled ahead of Mitt Romney in polling for the 2012 Republican presidential primary nod, said Sunday that when he used the word \"theology\" he was referring to a \"world view that elevates the Earth above man.\" That world view, Santorum continued, suggests that man could harm the Earth by using the resources available even while relying on claims that \"frankly are just not scientifically proven, for example, the politicization of the whole global warming debate.\" \"I mean, this is just all an attempt to, you know, to centralize power and to give more power to the government,\" Santorum said. Santorum said he never questioned the president's faith and repeatedly said he believes Obama is a Christian. \"He says he is a Christian. But I am talking about his world view or his -- the way he approaches problems in this country. And I think they're different than how most people do in America,\" he said. But while Gibbs said it's time to get off the \"mindset that if we disagree, we have to disqualify each other\" comments like Santorum's show that the GOP primary \"has been a race to the bottom. We have seen nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness, distortions of opponents' records, of the president's record.\" Santorum appeared on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" Gibbs was on ABC's \"This Week.\"",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, facing a growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown, shifted course on Saturday and offered Democrats a deal: temporary protections for roughly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border. But the proposal, which Mr. Trump unveiled in a 13-minute address from the White House, appeared dead on arrival in the Capitol. Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected it even before Mr. Trump spoke, and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, denounced the offer as \u201cnot a compromise but more hostage taking.\u201d With the shutdown entering its fifth week and polls showing a majority of the public blaming Mr. Trump, the president\u2019s advisers have been searching for an exit strategy. Saturday\u2019s speech grew out of talks that Vice President Mike Pence and the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, have had in recent days with lawmakers including Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. The proposal was Mr. Trump\u2019s first public offer to Democrats since the partial shutdown began nearly a month ago. It came after an acrimonious week of tit-for-tat politics, in which Ms. Pelosi told the president he could not deliver his State of the Union address in the Capitol until the shutdown was over, and the president retaliated by grounding a plane that was supposed to take Ms. Pelosi on a fact-finding mission to Afghanistan. In casting the plan as a compromise, the president sought to shift pressure to Democrats \u2014 who have repeatedly refused to give Mr. Trump any money for his border wall \u2014 to end the shutdown. But Democrats continued to insist they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump over border security until the government reopens. Over the course of his administration, Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to curb both legal and illegal immigration. He has revoked Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., which offers crucial protections for immigrants, for people from some Latin American and African countries. And he has moved to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an Obama-era program that shielded the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation. In the deal he outlined on Saturday, Mr. Trump offered to restore T.P.S. protection for 300,000 people, and said he would allow 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier. \u201cThat is our plan,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBorder security, DACA, T.P.S. Many other things. Straightforward, fair, reasonable and common sense with lots of compromise.\u201d The proposal, Mr. Trump added, was intended to \u201cbreak the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward.\u201d The speech was the second time during the shutdown that the president addressed the nation about the immigration crisis. But unlike his first address, a prime-time broadcast from the Oval Office that leaned heavily on dark messaging about the dangers of crime and illegal drugs flowing across the border, Mr. Trump seemed on Saturday to soften his tone. He paired the address with his first naturalization ceremony at the White House, a move intended to underscore the idea that he supports legal immigration. And his language was markedly different; instead of insisting on the \u201cbig beautiful wall\u201d he promised during his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump took care to use the word \u201cbarrier\u201d as well \u2014 and seemed to pare back his vision for it. Calling the wall \u201ca powerful and beautifully designed see-through steel barrier on our southern border,\u201d Mr. Trump said: \u201cThis is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea. These are steel barriers in high priority locations. Much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water.\u201d Mr. Trump noted that he had adopted some Democratic proposals on border security. The president proposed $800 million for humanitarian assistance and $805 million for drug detection technology, in addition to funding for 2,750 more border agents and law enforcement officials and 75 new immigration judge teams. In her talking points, issued to Democrats, Ms. Pelosi said her party favored \u201cnew drug, weapons and contraband scanning technology at official ports of entry,\u201d and \u201cfilling the more than 3,000 vacancies for customs officers.\u201d Ms. Pelosi also intends to bring up legislation in the coming days that includes an additional $1 billion for border security, including $563 million for 75 new immigration judges and support staff. Even so, Democrats roundly criticized the president\u2019s plan. They were particularly incensed that Mr. Trump\u2019s offer extended protections to Dreamers and T.P.S. recipients that he himself revoked. And they said the deal was a nonstarter because it did not offer any permanent protections for Dreamers. \u201cI think it\u2019s simply more fake promises raising false hopes,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said. \u201cIt will fool few Americans because it\u2019s neither serious nor credible as a real remedy for Dreamers.\u201d Some on the right also pushed back, describing the proposal as amnesty. James Carafano, a national security expert at the Heritage Foundation who worked on Mr. Trump\u2019s transition, was among the critics. \u201cAmnesty encourages further illegal immigration, incentivizes the tragedy of human trafficking and undermines our citizens\u2019 confidence in the rule of law,\u201d he said. Mr. Pence, briefing reporters after Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, said the speech reflected a painstaking process of listening to lawmakers, including rank-and-file Democrats who made it clear they believed that protections for DACA and T.P.S. recipients must be included in a border security deal. And he pushed back forcefully against critics like Mr. Carafano who said the measure amounted to an unacceptable amnesty for undocumented immigrants. \u201cThere is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal,\u201d Mr. Pence said. But that was one reason many Democrats considered it unacceptable. Other senior administration officials made it clear that part of Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy was to try to drive a wedge within the party between those who want to hold out for a much more generous solution and those who may feel enough political pressure to end the shutdown that they will feel obliged to support it. Noting that Tuesday is the deadline for the government to reopen in time to prevent federal employees from going a second consecutive pay period without a check, Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, said Senate Democrats had a tricky decision to make. He also noted that the president\u2019s ability to declare a national emergency was \u201cabsolutely\u201d still a tool available to Mr. Trump to find funds to build the wall if a legislative agreement could not be reached. Now it will be up to Mr. McConnell to put legislation incorporating Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal on the Senate floor. Mr. McConnell \u2014 who has insisted he will not put any legislation on the floor unless the president will sign it \u2014 spoke to Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Pence on Thursday night about finding a way forward. Mr. McConnell told the president that before he could bring up legislation on the Senate floor, he needed a \u201cpublic reassurance\u201d that Mr. Trump would sign it, one person close to the talks said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions. The president\u2019s proposal \u201cstrikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in a statement after Mr. Trump\u2019s speech. If Mr. McConnell does indeed put a bill on the floor, as the president said he would, Senate Democrats will have to decide whether to block it or let it come up for a vote. Despite Democrats\u2019 vow to reject the measure, it could create an opening for negotiations between the two sides. The shutdown stalemate is creating increasing nervousness on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states. One of them, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, is among only a handful of Republicans who have broken with the president and called for the government to reopen without a border security deal. On Saturday, she praised the president, saying she hoped that Mr. Trump\u2019s offer would \u201clead to constructive debate that will end this impasse.\u201d White House aides and allies of Mr. Trump said Saturday that Mr. Trump succeeded in ratcheting up the political pressure on Ms. Pelosi, especially if the Senate succeeded in passing a bill. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 talking points have been that the president is solely responsible for shutting down the government,\u201d Marc Short, the former White House legislative director, said. \u201cThis puts more onus on them to come back and say why this proposal is insufficient.\u201d But one reason Democrats are so leery of the deal is that they have been down this road with the president before. Last year, Mr. Trump and Mr. Schumer negotiated $25 billion in wall money for a pathway to citizenship for the Dreamers. But that deal fell apart when hard-line White House advisers persuaded the president to back away. The standoff over the shutdown, some former aides noted, was the first time Mr. Trump has had to engage in meaningful, high-stakes negotiations. But even that has come as a last resort, in what some have likened to negotiating out of desperation after failing to score political points.",

        "body": " In a rare statement issued Friday night, special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team disputed BuzzFeed\u2019s explosive report Thursday that said President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel, told BuzzFeed that its \u201cdescription\u201d of statements to Mueller\u2019s office, as well as the \u201ccharacterization\u201d of documents and testimony the office obtained, was inaccurate. \u201cBuzzFeed\u2019s description of specific statements to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u2019s Congressional testimony are not accurate,\u201d Carr told BuzzFeed. The special counsel\u2019s statement adds more confusion over what Mueller\u2019s team knows in its ongoing investigation into President Donald Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. Citing two federal law enforcement officials involved in the investigation, BuzzFeed\u2019s Thursday night report claimed that Trump directed Cohen to lie about negotiations over a Trump Tower in Moscow. Mueller\u2019s office, the report said, learned of Trump\u2019s orders to Cohen \u201cthrough interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents.\u201d According to BuzzFeed, \u201cCohen then acknowledged those instructions during his interviews with that office.\u201d Responding to the statement from Mueller\u2019s office on their report, BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith said it stands by its reporting and asked the special counsel\u2019s office to clarify its statement. \u201cWe stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what he\u2019s disputing,\u201d Smith tweeted. In a follow-up statement on Saturday, a BuzzFeed spokesman told The New York Times that the news site had \u201cre-confirmed\u201d its reporting and seen \u201cno indication that any specific aspect of our story is inaccurate.\u201d The special counsel\u2019s statement Friday homed in on the statements, documents and testimony that was obtained by Mueller, but it did not directly dispute that Trump had directed Cohen to lie to Congress, nor did it make mention of the Trump Tower deal in Moscow. BuzzFeed\u2019s original reporting sent Democrats on Capitol Hill into a furor as it suggested that Trump may have obstructed justice, thus providing grounds for impeachment or criminal charges. Some top Democrats called on Mueller to release what his team knows about Trump\u2019s Moscow deal as a matter of public duty. In a strong statement issued Friday night, Sen. Dianne Feinstein joined a chorus of her Democratic colleagues in threatening serious action, including impeachment, against Trump if the allegations proved true. Feinstein is a ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cWe\u2019ve previously known about attempts to develop Trump Tower Moscow and the misrepresentations surrounding those efforts,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cNow, media reports say President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about that business deal,\u201d Feinstein continued. \u201cIf true, the president committed a crime and must be held accountable.\u201d Earlier Friday, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) revealed that his committee had already begun searching for witnesses and documents to confirm BuzzFeed\u2019s report.  \u201cOur committee is already working to secure additional witness testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal and other investigative matters,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cAs a counterintelligence concern of the greatest magnitude, and given that these alleged efforts were intended to interfere with our investigation, our Committee is determined to get to the bottom of this and follow the evidence wherever it may lead,\u201d he added. Trump has maintained he is innocent and on Friday accused Cohen of lying to the special counsel in order to reduce his jail time.",

He raised just over $200,000 for his campaign, while Cantor spent more than $1 million in April and May alone to try to beat back his challenge.

In addition to teaching, he has served on the state Joint Advisory Board of Economists and served as the president of the Virginia Association of Economists.

        "body": " Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday demanded Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman over the California Democrat\u2019s repeated claims to have evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. In a letter, obtained by Fox News and signed by every Republican on the committee, the lawmakers slammed Schiff for his claims in the media that there was \u201cmore than circumstantial evidence\u201d of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. They repeated their demand in person during a feisty hearing Thursday morning. \u201cYour actions both past and present are incompatible with your duty as Chairman of this Committee,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cWe have no faith in your ability to discharge your duties in a manner consistent with your Constitutional responsibility and urge your immediate resignation as Chairman of this Committee.\u201d The letter follows the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe, which turned up no evidence of collusion between Trump campaign members and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. President Trump himself went even further than congressional Republicans Thursday morning, tweeting: \u201cCongressman Adam Schiff, who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking, should be forced to resign from Congress!\u201d Another top Republican, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, also lambasted Schiff on Thursday - comparing the California lawmaker to director Oliver Stone. \"He's made some pretty outrageous comments that Mueller could not verify, Graham said. \"He's getting into conspiracy land and he's acting like an Oliver Stone type figure. That to me is not helpful to him but I'm not going to ask him to resign for Congress.\" Schiff, a vocal critic of the president, has doubled down on his claim that Trump and his administration colluded with foreign powers despite Mueller\u2019s findings. \u201cUndoubtedly, there is collusion,\u201d Schiff told The Washington Post after Attorney General William Barr's four-page summary of Mueller's investigation was released Sunday. He told the paper that the question of whether Trump or the people around him were compromised by a hostile foreign power was not in any part of Mueller\u2019s report. The letter to Schiff was sent as those same Republicans confronted Schiff at the start of a Russia-themed hearing Thursday morning. Rep. Michael Conaway, R-Texas, attacked Schiff for driving a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d about collusion between Trump and Russia and \u201cundermining the faith\u201d of the American people. Conaway then went on to demand Schiff immediately resign his committee chairmanship, saying that Republicans on the committee have \u201cno faith in you.\u201d Schiff defended himself during Thursday\u2019s hearing \u2013 pointing to evidence of Russian hacking during the last presidential election, that Russian operatives offered dirt on Hillary Clinton during the campaign and that members of Trump\u2019s campaign and family took meetings with Russians. \u201cYou might think that\u2019s okay that they lied about the meeting,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s okay.\u201d Schiff on Monday signed a letter with his fellow House committee chairs demanding the full Mueller report by April 2. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said earlier this week that the mounting calls to remove Schiff were \"absolutely ridiculous.\" She consulted with Schiff and other committee leaders over the weekend as Barr notified Congress of Mueller's report and summarized the details. A Pelosi aide said Schiff was being attacked because he's done \"an outstanding job.\" \"Democrats aren't going to be intimidated by the White House or Congressional Republicans,\" spokeswoman Ashley Etienne said. \"We're not going to be distracted from securing the release of the full Mueller report and the underlying evidence, and we will continue to pursue legitimate oversight because that's what the Constitution requires.\"",

        "body": " Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, just told a group of reporters that failure to pass a package like the tax deal announced by President Obama this week \u201cwould significantly increase the risk\u201d of a double-dip recession. Mr. Summers made the remarks at a briefing with the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs and David Axelrod, the president\u2019s top political adviser. The administration has been pushing back hard against criticism from fellow Democrats that the president has caved too much to Republicans. In brief remarks after meeting with President Bronislaw Komorowski of Poland, Mr. Obama on Wednesday emphatically disputed that Democrats generally feel betrayed by his deal with Congressional Republicans on the tax cuts, saying that \u201cthe more who look at it, the more will say this makes sense.\u201d \u201cI just think it\u2019s very important for Congress to examine the agreement, look at the facts, have a thorough debate, but get this done. The American people are watching, and they\u2019re expecting action on our parts,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to translate that.\u201d In a joint appearance at the White House with Mr. Komorowski, Mr. Obama said that \u201ceconomists across the country have upwardly revised their forecasts for growth\u201d after the tax deal was announced on Monday night. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. planned to return to Capitol Hill this afternoon to meet with House Democrats as President Obama and the White House sought to quell the uproar among liberals about the tax deal. Officials said Mr. Biden will travel to the Hill around 4:30 p.m. in an attempt to sell the compromise Mr. Obama announced this week. It will be the second time in two days that Mr. Biden has served as the liaison-in-chief for the White House. Mr. Biden\u2019s visit and the president\u2019s comments come as the administration\u2019s message machine started churning out statements of support. To counter condemnations from some Democrats in Congress, the White House circulated a series of e-mails quoting endorsements from private-sector economic forecasters, liberal as well as conservative analysts, and Democratic officeholders, including an obscure freshman House member, Representative Gary Peters of Michigan. By noon, the White House press office had released supportive comments from Antonio Villaraigosa, the mayor of Los Angeles, and Mr. Peters. The Democratic National Committee alerted reporters that Jennifer Granholm, the Democratic governor of Michigan, also supports the deal. John Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and a close ally of Mr. Obama, issued a statement calling the tax deal \u201ca steep price\u201d but saying the president was \u201cright to choose helping working Americans over a December conflagration.\u201d  The Democratic National Committee also sent that statement around to reporters. David Axelrod, the president\u2019s chief political adviser, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cAmerican Morning\u201d that middle-class Americans were \u201cgoing to get screwed\u201d if their tax cuts were not extended at the end of the year. The administration was quick to highlight comments from Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019sEconomy.com, projecting that the Obama tax deal would increase economic growth next year by 1.25 percentage points and create 1.6 million jobs. Macroeconomic Advisors, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs projected smaller increases but no less than at least 0.5 percentage point. That is on top of projections that currently are in the range of 2 percent to 3 percent. But the public relations offensive is being met with public expressions of outrage from Mr. Obama\u2019s base, including the most liberal members of Congress and spokesmen for interest groups on the left. Close to three dozen House Democrats have signed a letter from Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, calling the tax deal \u201cfiscally irresponsible\u201d and \u201cgrossly unfair.\u201d The letter says Mr. Obama \u201cshould not back down. Nor should we.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s visit with the House Democrats is likely to be as contentious as the one that he led with their Senate colleagues on Tuesday \u2014 if not more so. Despite the closed-door lunchtime meeting, Senate aides told The Times afterward that about 30 Democratic senators remained \u201cfirmly opposed\u201d to the president\u2019s negotiated deal after hearing from the vice president. In the House, Democratic lawmakers said Wednesday morning that the sense of disappointment with the president remained strong. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was preordained that if we had a deadlock, they would have won it,\u201d said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, in an interview on MSNBC. \u201cI\u2019m not going to vote for it. I don\u2019t feel that I should be coerced.\u201d",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2015 President Donald Trump\u2019s partial government shutdown over his border wall closed in on the two-week mark and a brand-new Congress on Wednesday with no end in sight. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker-to-be Nancy Pelosi made their first visit to the White House since their Dec. 11 meeting with Trump, when he said he would be \u201cproud\u201d to take responsibility for a government shutdown in his effort to force Congress to spend billions of dollars on a wall along the southern border. On Wednesday, the Democratic leaders emerged from the White House after 90 minutes, unified on not giving in to Trump. \u201cThey are now feeling the heat,\u201d Schumer said. Pelosi, who is expected to return to the House speakership Thursday afternoon after eight years as minority leader, intends as her first action to pass spending bills that won Republican support last year to reopen the closed agencies. \u201cWe\u2019re asking the president to open the government,\u201d she told reporters on the White House driveway. \u201cWe are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do that?\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, though, said he will not take up legislation that Trump has not endorsed, which means the shutdown will continue. About a quarter of the federal government ran out of operating money at midnight Dec. 21 after Trump reneged on his commitment to a sign a short-term spending bill that had already passed the Senate on a unanimous vote. Trump changed his mind after Fox News and talk radio hosts ridiculed him for again backing down on his demand for wall money. Trump is now insisting that Congress appropriate $5.7 billion for that project, while Democrats want a short-term spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security and full-year funding for the other affected agencies while funding for the wall is negotiated separately. In the meantime, about 800,000 federal employees \u2015 about half furloughed, half deemed \u201cessential\u201d and required to work anyway \u2015 face real problems with their household finances. Many will miss their first paycheck on Jan. 11 unless Trump signs a spending bill before then. Employees would have to dip into their savings or borrow money to pay their bills, as there is no government program to help them. Trump, however, did not mention them during extended remarks he offered shortly before his meeting with the eight top Democratic and Republican congressional leaders. When asked how long the shutdown would last, the president replied, \u201cAs long as it takes,\u201d calling his wall, a signature campaign promise, a matter of \u201cnational security.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments came at what was billed as the first Cabinet meeting of 2019. Instead, Trump spent the first hour and a half of it complaining about a variety of issues, such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis\u2019 performance and the late Sen. John McCain\u2019s vote against Trump\u2019s repeal of Obamacare, as well as offering his musings on such things as the utility of wheels and his desire for Russia to invade Afghanistan again. Trump\u2019s remarks were riddled with falsehoods on everything from trade to the number of illegal immigrants in the country to the way NATO works. The White House did not respond to HuffPost queries about whether Trump understood that what he was saying was false and, if he did, why he was doing so anyway. Trump promised hundreds of times during his campaign that the wall would cost taxpayers nothing because he would get Mexico to pay for it. But since taking office, Trump has never asked Mexico for payment. Instead, he began threatening to shut down the government early last year unless Congress gave him billions of dollars to build it \u2015 even though the type of structure he wants remains unclear. During the campaign, he promised a \u201cgreat, great\u201d wall made of reinforced concrete that would rise 30 feet or more and extend so far underground that it would be impossible to tunnel underneath. In recent months, he has at times said the wall could just be steel slats, which would be like the \u201cbollard fencing\u201d developed during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. In a tweet Wednesday morning, Trump claimed, falsely, that Mexico was already paying for a border wall, thanks to a newly renegotiated trade deal, and that the wall was already largely done but he needed billions of dollars anyway. Despite numerous requests over several weeks, the White House has not provided any economic analysis to back up Trump\u2019s claims. Outside economists and trade experts, however, said the revisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has rebranded the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, will not bring in to the U.S. Treasury anywhere near what is necessary to pay for a wall. More important, what extra money does come in will be from tariffs, which are paid by people in the U.S., not Mexico.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Two days after suddenly halting his own administration\u2019s decision to begin allowing hunters to import elephants killed in two African countries, President Donald Trump called such trophy hunting a \u201chorror show\u201d and said he\u2019s unlikely to change his mind and allow such imports. \u201cBig-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal,\u201d he posted to Twitter Sunday evening. In the face of widespread public backlash, Tump announced late Friday that he has suspended \u2014 at least for now \u2014 his administration\u2019s decision to reverse an Obama-era ban on the importation of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia. \u201cPut big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts,\u201d he posted to Twitter. He adding that the issue has been \u201cunder study for years\u201d but that he would provide an update after additional review. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a statement on Twitter that he and Trump \u201cbelieve that conservation & healthy herds are critical.\u201d As HuffPost reported Wednesday, the administration optedto lift the 2014 ban after determining that sport hunting of elephants in those African countries would \u201cenhance the survival of the species in the wild,\u201d a spokesperson for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. It also recently rolled back protections for African lions, releasing new guidelines that allow big game hunters to bring back to the U.S. animal trophies from hunts in parts of Africa. The decision regarding elephants was made public not by the federal agency but via a celebratory news release early Tuesday from Safari Club International, a trophy hunting advocacy group that, along with the National Rifle Association, sued to block the 2014 ban. Greg Sheehan, principal deputy director of the FWS, broke the news to the hunting organization during the African Wildlife Consultative Forum in Tanzania, an agency spokesperson told HuffPost. The forum, which ended Friday, was hosted by the Safari Club International Foundation and the United Republic of Tanzania. The Safari Club\u2019s political action committees donated a collective $24,500 to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Zinke\u2019s 2014 and 2016 congressional campaigns, according to Federal Election Commission data. Zinke is a former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL. Conservation groups celebrated Trump\u2019s sudden change in course Friday, which was believed to be a response to public pressure. \u201cIt\u2019s great that public outrage has forced Trump to reconsider this despicable decision, but it takes more than a tweet to stop trophy hunters from slaughtering elephants and lions,\u201d Tanya Sanerib, senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. \u201cWe need immediate federal action to reverse these policies and protect these amazing animals.\u201d In a post to Twitter, Wayne Pacelle, the CEO of The Humane Society of the United States, said he was \u201cgrateful\u201d that Trump would reconsider. \u201cThis is the kind of trade we don\u2019t need.\u201d The elephant trophy decision drew national headlines and a fierce response from celebrities and others across social media. Talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres launched a campaign called #BeKindToElephants. By lifting the ban, she said, Trump was \u201cencouraging Americans to kill elephants.\u201d A day after Trump\u2019s suspension, the Safari Club sent out a \u201ccall to arms,\u201d encouraging hunters to contact Trump and Zinke and \u201ctell them how much you appreciate the efforts of the Fish & Wildlife Service to remove barriers to sustainable use conservation for African wildlife.\u201d And they blasted \u201chysterical anti-hunters and news media outlets.\u201d \u201cThe news from Africa could not have been better for hunters or for anyone who loves or defends hunting culture,\u201d the group wrote. African elephants have been listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act since 1978. A provision of the law, however, allows for sport-hunted trophies to be imported if the government determines that hunting will help safeguard the population. The FWS concluded that Zimbabwe has made strides to improve elephant management and anti-poaching efforts, according to a notice published Friday in the Federal Register. Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was among the many people who called on Trump to abandon his trophy hunting decision. In a Friday statement, Royce pointed to the unrest in Zimbabwe \u2014 where a military coup is thought to be unfolding \u2014 and said he has no confidence that the regime is properly managing conservation programs. \u201cElephants and other big game in Africa are blood currency for terrorist organizations, and they are being killed at an alarming rate,\u201d Royce said. \u201cStopping poaching isn\u2019t just about saving the world\u2019s most majestic animals for the future \u2015 it\u2019s about our national security.\u201d Hours before Trump\u2019s review announcement, the FWS defended its decision as \u201cpart of a robust United States conservation strategy that seeks to eliminate poaching and associated wildlife trafficking.\u201d",

Strzok attorney Aitan Goelman said in a statement Monday that his client, a 21-year FBI veteran, was fired Friday afternoon, claiming this was a departure from standard practice and politically motivated.  Goelman said bureau Deputy Director David Bowdich \u201coverruled\u201d the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility to remove him.  \u201cThis decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans,\u201d the attorney said.  The FBI responded: \u201cMr. Strzok was subject to the standard FBI review and disciplinary process after conduct highlighted in the IG report was referred to the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR).  OPR reviewed the investigative materials, as well as the written and oral responses of Mr. Strzok and his counsel, and issued OPR's decision.  The Deputy Director, as the senior career FBI official, has the delegated authority to review and modify any disciplinary findings and/or penalty as deemed necessary in the best interest of the FBI.\u201d Strzok appeared to launch a new Twitter account to fire back, saying he's \"deeply saddened\" by the decision and linking to a GoFundMe page.  President Trump and his allies for months, though, have hammered the former FBI agent and cast him as the poster child for anti-Trump bias within the bureau and Justice Department.  Reacting to the firing, the president tweeted, \"finally,\" while asking whether the Russia case will now be dropped: \"Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally.  The list of bad players in the FBI & DOJ gets longer & longer.  Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped?  It is a total Hoax.  No Collusion, No Obstruction - I just fight back!\" The president over the weekend had tweeted that Strzok and others have \u201cbadly damaged\u201d the FBI\u2019s reputation, referring to them as \u201cclowns and losers!\u201d  Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe last year after the discovery that he exchanged anti-Trump and other politically charged messages with colleague and lover Lisa Page.  Judicial Watch Director of Investigations Chris Farrell on how FBI official Peter Strzok requested that he retain his security clearance after being added to special counsel Robert Mueller's team.  In June, he was then escorted from his FBI office and lost his security clearance amid the release of a scathing DOJ inspector general report that largely dealt with the DOJ and FBI\u2019s handling of the investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email server but uncovered messages that \u201cappeared to mix political opinion with discussions\u201d about that probe -- namely, between Strzok and Page.    The IG ultimately found no evidence that the bias among the several FBI agents impacted prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton email probe.  But Republicans have repeatedly raised concerns that anti-Trump bias played a role in the start of the investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump associates in 2016.  One Strzok text in particular vowed to \"stop\" Trump from becoming president.  In an explosive congressional hearing last month, Strzok sought to clear his name and address the many controversial messages.  He claimed his personal opinions did not affect his work. But Republicans tore into the FBI official, with House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy saying he exhibited \"textbook bias.\"  Trump's allies cheered the former agent's termination on Monday.  \"Peter Strzok was fired from the FBI because of what his own written words plainly showed:  he was willing to use his official FBI position to try and stop President Trump from getting elected.  He tarnished the FBI's sterling reputation and severely damaged public trust in an institution where trust is paramount.  His conduct should deeply concern every American,\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said in a statement to Fox News.  Strzok\u2019s attorney, meanwhile, blasted the bureau on Monday, saying the deputy director \u201creversed the decision of the career FBI official responsible for employee discipline who concluded, through an independent review process, that a 60-day suspension and demotion from supervisory duties was the appropriate punishment.\u201d He added, \u201cA lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of Congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzok\u2019s personal views ever affected his work.\u201d  The Justice Department declined to comment for this report.  Text messages first emerged last year, showing Strzok and Page discussing 2016 campaign politics and repeatedly blasting Trump.  In one message, Strzok called Trump an \"idiot.\"  Messages continued to trickle out, including some reflecting apparent concern about being too tough on Clinton during the investigation into her private email system use.  The inspector general report, meanwhile, referred a total of five FBI employees for investigation in connection with politically charged texts, suggesting more disciplinary action could be considered for additional employees.  Lisa Page left the bureau earlier this year. ",

        "body": " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid broke with President Obama Monday over the proposed mosque near Ground Zero, saying the controversial Islamic center should be built elsewhere. Spokesman Jim Manley said in a written statement that Republicans should show their sincerity about sensitivity to Sept. 11 survivors by backing a high-profile bill to grant health benefits to rescue workers, something that stalled in Congress earlier this month. But at the same time, Manley put Reid on the record for the first time in the hyper-sensitive and volatile mosque debate. \"The First Amendment protects freedom of religion,\" Manley said. \"Sen. Reid respects that but thinks that the mosque should be built someplace else.\" Reid's comments added another high-profile voice to the mosque controversy. The president first stepped into the fray Friday when he appeared to endorse the Park 51 project during a Ramadan dinner at the White House. The next day, he clarified that he was merely commenting on fundamental religious freedoms -- not specifically on the \"wisdom\" of the mosque project. Then White House spokesman Bill Burton said Obama was not \"backing off\" his original remarks. The prolonged presidential explanation elevated the issue beyond a local dispute and hurled it into the political arena. Republicans have since both criticized his position and pressured other Democrats to take a stand on the politically sticky issue, one where charges of insensitivity have flown on both sides. The White House claimed Monday that politics were not at play in Obama's decision to dive into the controversy over a planned mosque near Ground Zero. Burton said that he \"can't speak to the politics of what the Republicans are doing,\" but the president was not looking to make political hay with his remarks, which he reportedly considered carefully before delivering them at a White House dinner on Friday night. \"The president didn't do this because of the politics. He spoke about it because he feels he has an obligation as the president to address this,\" Burton said. But the issue was quickly feeding fuel to Republicans looking to corner Democrats into taking a position on the issue -- something they were able to avoid before the president spoke up. Though Reid is on the record, the National Republican Senatorial Committee on Monday targeted Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., for not speaking out on the issue. Citing an article that said the normally chatty Schumer would not comment on the mosque remarks, the NRSC said Schumer should weigh in. \"It's a remarkable commentary on the most camera-friendly senator that he's more than happy to weigh-in on caffeinated malt beverages, but he won't take a public position on the construction of a mosque near Ground Zero,\" NRSC spokesman Brian Walsh said in a written statement. \"It's time for Chuck Schumer to stand up and be counted -- does he stand with President Obama in support of this mosque or does he stand with the countless 9/11 families who believe its location is inappropriate?\" Walsh asked. Walsh also suggested Reid would suffer politically from his allegiance to Obama on other issues, despite his stance on the mosque. \"While it's commendable that Senator Reid now agrees with Republican Sharron Angle that we should respect the wishes of 9/11 families, it's regrettable that he hasn't demonstrated this same independence from President Obama on the critical issues facing America during the last 19 months,\" he said. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who opposes the mosque project, said Monday that the White House softened Obama's original comments because it probably heard \"pushback\" from other Democrats. He said Obama was \"clearly\" taking a side on the issue no matter what he claims. \"Everyone says as far as I know that the Muslim community has the right to build a mosque. The whole question is whether they should or not,\" he told Fox News. \"So for the president to raise it in the way he did on Friday was clearly giving the impression that he was endorsing it or supporting it -- or tacitly supporting it.\" Most Americans think the group planning the mosque and Islamic cultural center has the right to build it, according to a Fox News poll released Friday. However, the poll showed that 64 percent think it would be wrong to build it, regardless of whether the developers are within their right to do so. Supporters of the mosque and cultural center in lower Manhattan, including New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, say its development should stand as a testament to religious tolerance in America. They say it would be a mistake to equate Islam as a whole, and its practice in the United States, with Al Qaeda -- and remind critics that Muslims were also killed in the attacks on the World Trade Center. Burton said Monday that the president weighed in as part of a constitutional discussion. \"The president thinks that it's his obligation to speak out when ... issues of the Constitution arise. And so, in this case, he decided to state clearly how he feels about making sure that people are treated equally, that there is a fairness and that our bedrock principles are upheld,\" Burton said. He added the administration can't control the conversation on cable TV or in newspapers, but the White House has had a \"pretty fulsome conversation\" about it and has addressed it to a \"pretty full extent.\" \"I think that it's a debate that was had and we've weighed in,\" Burton said.",

        "body": " Several prominent conservatives offered swift, negative reactions to Michael Steele on Friday, after the RNC chairman was caught on camera saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama\u2019s choosing.  The pushback crested with Bill Kristol \u2014 still an influential voice among Republican lawmakers \u2014 writing a letter to Steele on his Weekly Standard site calling for the RNC leader\u2019s resignation. \u201cNeedless to say, the war in Afghanistan was not \u201ca war of Obama\u2019s choosing.\u201d It has been prosecuted by the United States under Presidents Bush and Obama. Republicans have consistently supported the effort. Indeed, as the DNC Communications Director (of all people) has said, your statement \u201cputs [you] at odds with about 100 percent of the Republican Party. And not on a trivial matter. At a time when Gen. Petraeus has just taken over command, when Republicans in Congress are pushing for a clean war funding resolution, when Republicans around the country are doing their best to rally their fellow citizens behind the mission, your comment is more than an embarrassment. It\u2019s an affront, both to the honor of the Republican party and to the commitment of the soldiers fighting to accomplish the mission they\u2019ve been asked to take on by our elected leaders. There are, of course, those who think we should pull out of Afghanistan, and they\u2019re certainly entitled to make their case. But one of them shouldn\u2019t be the chairman of the Republican party.\u201d Kristol\u2019s was the harshest of all the reactions to the Steele, whose spokesman, it should be noted, tried to clarify the comment by insisting that he merely meant that President Obama has not been forthcoming with a winning strategy.  But the Weekly Standard editor was not alone. Another major neoconservative figure, Dan Senor, told the Huffington Post that Steele\u2019s comments are \u201cutterly irresponsible.\u201d Senor, who served under the Bush administration as chief spokesman in Iraq and has been a major booster of efforts to escalate U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, noted that Steele\u2019s RNC actually sponsored a conference call for his group to praise Obama\u2019s Afghan surge last year.  Indeed, even Steele himself declared back in December that Afghanistan is \u201c\u2019a war we have to win\u201d \u2014 a far cry from the comments he made Thursday night, in which he said: \u201c...you don\u2019t do is engage in a land war in Afghanistan, alright, because everyone who\u2019s tried over a thousand years of history has failed.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s completely inconsistent with this latest statement,\u201d summarized Senor.  In a bit of irony, Steele\u2019s most recent comments have actually resonated among anti-war Democrats who share the skepticism that Afghanistan is a winnable enterprise. They also, in some respects, echo the opinions of some members of the conservative community (Joe Scarborough and George Will among them) who have been critical of the deployment of U.S. forces in that country.  But Steele is not an anti-war Democrat. Nor is he a pundit. He is the figurehead of the Republican Party whose tenure, once again, seems shaky. Shortly after Kristol called for his resignation, a GOP operative began pitching the column to reporters, hoping that the meme of Steele\u2019s troubles would spread far and wide.",

        "body": " President Trump\u2019s immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown drew sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike. In a televised White House address on Saturday afternoon, Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, in exchange for the $5.7 billion he has been seeking for a barrier along the nation's southern border with Mexico. \u201cOur immigration system should be a source of pride ... not a source of shame as it is all over the world,\u201d Trump said in his plea. The president\u2019s proposal was met with disdain from an array of top Democratic lawmakers. Many used the same language in their critiques, accusing Trump of holding the government and federal workers \"hostage.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted, \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t hear from the President was any sympathy for the federal workers who face so much uncertainty because of the chaos of the #TrumpShutdown.\u201d Before Trump made his announcement, Pelosi had called his anticipated proposal \u201ca non-starter.\u201d \u201cFor one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports.\u201d For his part, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, called Trump's proposal \"one-sided and ineffective.\" \"It's clear the President realizes that by closing the government and hurting so many American workers and their families, he has put himself and the country in an untenable position. Unfortunately, he keeps putting forward one-sided and ineffective remedies. There's only one way out: open the government, Mr. President, and then Democrats and Republicans can have a civil discussion and come up with bipartisan solutions.\" Schumer, D-N.Y., concluded, \"It was the President who single-handedly took away DACA and TPS protections in the first place \u2013 offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking.\" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer shared a similar sentiment, urging Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell to \"stop holding government hostage and end the shutdown\" immediately. \u201cThe president must stop holding government hostage and end the shutdown so federal employees can get back to work serving the American people. There is no reason for Americans to be shut out of work and without a paycheck while negotiations take place on the best way to secure our borders,\u201d he said. Hoyer said negotiation can progress after the government reopens. \u201cWith the government open, we can negotiate an agreement to strengthen border security that both sides can support and that is in the best interests of the American people.\u201d Another leading Dem, Sen. Kristen Gillibrand of New York, who announced her White House bid on Jan. 15 in an episode of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" said Trump's offer was a \"bad deal.\" Gillibrand tweeted: \"Trump ordered the end of DACA and TPS. Then he shut down the government. Now he's holding federal workers hostage, saying he'll temporarily give back what he took away -- only if we give him a pointless, ineffective wall he falsely promised Mexico would pay for. This is a bad deal.\" Then there was New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez's response. He bluntly accused Trump of forcing \"a pointless shutdown\" to pay for the border wall. \"This is about more than 800,000 Americans who are being held hostage by a President who has forced a pointless shutdown to pay for an expensive, ineffective wall. This is not about immigration. Dreamers and TPS recipients are not bargaining chips. It's unacceptable that after taking away DACA protections, eliminating the TPS program for thousands of immigrants and creating a humanitarian crisis at the border, President Trump is offering temporary solutions in exchange for a permanent wall.\" The Democratic senator also said \"a legitimate negotiation\" can proceed after the government is reopened. Fellow Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware slammed McConnell for refusing \"to meaningfully negotiate with Senate Democrats,\" but also called Trump's offer \"a first step toward comprehensive immigration reform.\" \"This senseless government shutdown is hurting millions of Americans, and its impacts are only getting worse. The President should re-open the government so that Republicans and Democrats in Congress can work with the White House to find a sensible solution on border security and immigration. I am confident that a reasonable compromise can be reached, but not while President Trump continues to keep significant parts of the government shut down and Leader McConnell refuses to meaningfully negotiate with Senate Democrats,\" he said. \"Some relief for Dreamers and an extension of Temporary Protected Status represent a first step toward comprehensive immigration reform, but more ideas from members of both parties should be taken up and debated. Republicans and Democrats stand ready to work toward a solution, but the fact remains that there is no reason to have large parts of the federal government shut down while we debate appropriate border security and immigration policies.\" Republican lawmakers, at the opposite end of the reaction spectrum, praised the president for his willingness to negotiate. Senate Majority Leader McConnell, for instance, commended the president \"for taking bipartisan steps toward addressing current immigration issues.\" In his statement, he said; \u201cCompromise in divided government means that everyone can\u2019t get everything they want every time. The president\u2019s proposal reflects that. It strikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle.\" \u201cThis bill takes a bipartisan approach to re-opening the closed portions of the federal government. It pairs the border security investment that our nation needs with additional immigration measures that both Democrat and Republican members of Congress believe are necessary. Unlike the bills that have come from the House over the past few weeks, this proposal could actually resolve this impasse. It has the full support of the President and could be signed into law to quickly reopen the government.\" Republican Whip Steve Scalise called on Democrats to match Trump's willingness to negotiate. \"The time for political games has long passed. Democrats must put their personal dislike of the president aside, end their obstruction, and finally come to the negotiating table. It's time Democrats do what is right for the functioning and security of our nation and agree to a deal that opens our government, and includes funding for a border wall and other measures to solve this serious immigration crisis at our southern border,\" he said in a statement. Also on the Republican side, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she was \"hopeful\" for a \"constructive debate\" with Democrats. \u201cCompromise is not a sign of weakness \u2014 it\u2019s a sign of strength, particularly when hundreds of thousands of families are being harmed. The Administration, Senate Republicans, and Democrats must now resolve this stalemate before 800,000 federal workers and their families miss yet another paycheck, and our economy is further damaged,\u201d she said. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose views on the president and his policies have fluctuated, said Trump \"put forth a reasonable, good faith proposal that will reopen the government and help secure the border.\" He tweeted, \"I look forward to voting for it and will work to encourage my Republican and Democratic colleagues to do the same. Earlier, while speaking in Ogden, Utah, Romney said he did not understand Pelosi's position on border security. \"You (Pelosi) and your fellow Democrats have voted for over 600 miles of border fence in the past, why won't you vote for another few miles now? I don't understand their position, I really don't,\" the Republican senator said. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio took a positive view of Trump's proposed deal, like his fellow Republicans. He said Trump made \"a very reasonable offer\" and urged Democrats to work with him. \u201cThe way to end this shutdown is for both sides to make mutual concessions in order to reach an agreement. The president has made a very reasonable offer to extend DACA and TPS protections in exchange for the border security measures he supports. I hope that instead of choosing the road of endless obstruction, Democrats will decide to work with him to reach an agreement and end the shutdown,\u201d he said. Likewise, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy called the president's immigration offer \"reasonable.\" McCarthy tweeted: \"President Trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government. The moment now turns to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The country is watching.\" ",

Jay Inslee (D) announced Monday that he would ban state-funded travel to Indiana, where a controversial new law could allow businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons. \u201cI find Indiana\u2019s new law disturbing, particularly at a time when more and more states and people in America are embracing civil rights for everyone,\" Inslee said in a statement. \"Washington will join other states and cities in opposing this law and I will impose an administration-wide ban on state funded travel to Indiana.\" In his statement, Inslee cited the case of a Washington-based florist who was recently ordered to pay a fine for discriminating against a gay couple who sought her services. \"We in Washington stand for equality,\" he said. \"I applaud those companies and organizations that have spoken out against the law and said they would not locate or expand operations in Indiana. I want to invite all those organizations, and anyone interested in a state that promotes equality and opportunity, to come visit Washington. We are open for business, and open to all people.\" Earlier Monday, Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy (D) took a similar stand against the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed into law by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) at a private ceremony last week. The measure has sparked national backlash, with critics warning that the law provides legal justification for discrimination against LGBT individuals. In addition to Connecticut and Washington, San Francisco and Seattle have also imposed bans on city-funded travel to the state. The mayors of Minnesota's Twin Cities, Minneapolis and St. Paul, have also condemned the measure. The cities and states are joined by a number of business leaders speaking out against the law. Apple chief Tim Cook called the law \"dangerous\" in a Washington Post op-ed, while Salesforce's Marc Benioff canceled the company's planned events in the state. And on Monday, the executives of nine Indiana-based companies, including Angie's List and Anthem, sent a letter to Pence outlining their concerns. \"Regardless of the original intention of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, we are deeply concerned about the impact it is having on our employees and on the reputation of our state,\" reads the letter. Pence has defended his decision to sign the bill, claiming that the measure has been \"grossly misconstrued as a 'license to discriminate.'\" \"I abhor discrimination. I believe in the Golden Rule that you should 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you,'\" Pence wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. \"If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn\u2019t eat there anymore. As governor of Indiana, if I were presented a bill that legalized discrimination against any person or group, I would veto it. Indiana\u2019s new law contains no reference to sexual orientation. It simply mirrors federal law that President Bill Clinton signed in 1993.\" However, the governor and legislative leaders say they will seek to clarify that the law does not protect discrimination. \u201cIt is not the intent of the law to discriminate against anyone, and it will not be allowed to discriminate against anyone,\u201d state Senate President Pro Tem David Long (R) said. \u201cWe hope to have a fix very soon.\"",

        "body": " The battle for control of the Republican National Committee will take a new turn on Monday when Michael Steele announces whether he plans to step down as party chairman or will disregard the onslaught of criticism about his oversight of the committee and seek a second term. Mr. Steele is expected to disclose his intentions during a conference call with committee members on Monday evening. Mr. Steele has lost the backing of many top supporters, but he has not yet said whether he will try to rebuild his frayed coalition and fight for the chance to lead the party into the 2012 election cycle. Mr. Steele\u2019s tenure has been one of the few blemishes this year for the Republican Party, which scored historic victories in the midterm elections. At least six top Republicans have already taken steps to run for party chairman and several members have withdrawn their support for Mr. Steele, leading many party leaders to conclude that Mr. Steele will not seek reelection. But Mr. Steele has kept close counsel about his future, Republican officials said Sunday, and his plans were unknown even to several of his own advisers. A spokesman for the R.N.C. did not respond to inquiries about the conference call, which Mr. Steele announced personally in a weekend e-mail message to fellow Republicans. \u201cDear Members, Please join me for a private conference call,\u201d Mr. Steele wrote in a message to Republicans, which was provided to the New York Times by a committee member. \u201cThank you and I look forward to talking to you Monday evening.\u201d A coordinated effort to replace Mr. Steele has been underway for weeks, with several leading Republicans arguing that the committee needed to urgently improve its fund-raising practices and tighten its organizational structure to prepare for the presidential election. The political director of the committee resigned in protest last month and is among those vying for the job. Mr. Steele, a former lieutenant governor of Maryland, was elected in January 2009 to lead Republicans at a bleak moment. He has argued that he deserves credit for building the party in all corners of the country and winning control of the House of Representatives last month. The contenders for the position include: Reince Preibus, chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party; Ann Wagner of Missouri, an ambassador to Luxembourg in the Bush administration; Maria Cino, a veteran Republican operative who has the support of former Vice President Dick Cheney; Saul Anuzis, former Republican chairman in Michigan; and Gentry Collins, who resigned last month as political director. A former party chairman, Mike Duncan, also is considering a run. The 168-member committee will elect a chairman during its meeting in January.",

Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday was appointed to an eighth term as House minority leader, surviving a challenge from a Midwestern Democrat backed by caucus members frustrated over repeated election loses and an aging leadership team. Pelosi was challenged by Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan in a secret-ballot vote among House Democrats. She won by a 134-to-63 vote. Pelosi said afterward that she was \u201cexhilarated\u201d by the strong support and reminded reporters that she had accurately predicted winning two-thirds of the vote. She has winning brought \u201ca special spring in my step\u201d because it gives her the opportunity to \u201cdifferentiate between us and the administration coming in January.\" Ryan, after a disappointing 2016 election cycle for Democrats, argued that newer lawmakers in the party need a bigger, fresher voice to represent them, instead of the same slate of leaders and committee chairmen. He represents northeast Ohio, a region full of the type of disaffected union workers and former Democrats who helped Republican Donald Trump win that battleground state and the White House. \u201cClearly, this didn\u2019t turn out the way we wanted,\u201d Ryan said after the vote. \u201cWe knew it was going to be an uphill battle. \u2026 We needed to get out the economic message. I\u2019m disappointed, but I think the party\u2019s better off because of this.\u201d Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, among the handful of House Democrats who backed Ryan's bid, said the effort to unseat Pelosi was not a failure. \u201cWe didn\u2019t lose today,\u201d she said, interrupting reporters at the post-vote press conference. \u201cWe now have a leadership team that listens to us. \u2026 Today, we made our caucus more representative of our members.\u201d Another criticism among rank-and-file House Democrats was that the top posts are largely filled by East and West coast members, not those from the heartland. Pelosi has led House Democrats since 2002. Democrats lost the House majority in the 2010 Tea Party-inspired wave election. And Republican-led redistricting has made chances of a Democratic comeback increasingly difficult. The 76-year-old Pelosi, in the months prior to the Nov. 8 elections, repeatedly vowed that her party would retake control of the lower chamber, despite needing to gain roughly 35 seats. \u201cWe know how to win elections,\u201d she said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it in the past and we\u2019ll do it again. This is so much bigger that politics.\u201d Pelosi also described her upcoming role of contrasting Democrats to Republican President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration as a \u201chistoric challenge\u201d that goes \u201cbeyond politics.\u201d Leadership elections were originally scheduled to be held before Thanksgiving but were delayed to give Democrats more time to discuss and process the election results and consider a path forward. Many are discouraged after losing the White House and making smaller than expected gains in both chambers of Congress. \"I believe we must do more than simply paper over the cracks,\" said Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, one of a handful of House Democrats to endorse Ryan. \"We can't just say the right things -- we must take concrete steps to move our party in the right direction.\" In the days before Wednesday\u2019s vote, Pelosi, a prolific fundraiser, promised some changes to assuage concerns in her caucus, including adding a member of the freshmen class to her leadership team. She won despite her proposals doing little to ensure new blood at the very top or changing the seniority system that has key committees led by lawmakers in their 80s at a moment when the party needs to be defending ObamaCare and other initiatives by President Obama. Republicans are on track to hold at least 240 seats in the House next year. Democrats, who had high hopes of significant gains in the election, picked up just six seats on Election Day earlier this month and remain in the minority with 194 seats. Rep. Loretta Sanchez won the competition for vice Democratic Caucus chairman, defeating fellow California congresswoman Barbara Lee. Lee is a former Congressional Black Caucus chairman. Sanchez formerly led the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Democrats until Wednesday had never had a female minority in their leadership ranks. \u201cI\u2019m really honored and emotional to be standing here among a group of such great leaders,\u201d Sanchez said in second, late-afternoon press conference led by Pelosi. Other top leadership posts were uncontested. Reps. Steny Hoyer, Maryland, kept the No. 2 job of House minority whip, and Jim Clyburn, South Carolina, remained in No. 3 position of assistant leader.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2015 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was re-elected to her leadership post Wednesday morning. But more than 60 Democrats voted against her \u2015 a stunning level of dissent at a time when the party is trying to pick up the pieces after a disastrous presidential election. Pelosi defeated her lone challenger, Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio), by a vote of 134 to 63. It\u2019s a decisive win, and it (barely) clears the two-thirds majority support that Pelosi predicted she had. But it reveals that dozens in her caucus voted against her in secret ballots. That\u2019s a lot. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of anger,\u201d said one Democrat who opposed her, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely. \u201cI\u2019m astounded that this caucus refuses to acknowledge reality and change.\u201d Pelosi has led House Democrats since 2003, and that\u2019s what Ryan had argued is the problem. The same people have been running the caucus for years \u2015 Pelosi, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.) and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn (S.C.) \u2015 and they\u2019re all in their 70s now. Some say they\u2019re not the right messengers to energize the base and convey an economic message that appeals to people beyond the two coasts. House Democrats have also lost nearly 60 seats over the past six years. They picked up just six seats in this election cycle \u2015 far fewer than expected. Pelosi\u2019s supporters said her experience is what the party needs now more than ever, going up against President-elect Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress: She\u2019s battle-tested, she\u2019s a prolific fundraiser and she knows better than anyone how to count votes and keep her party together. They say it\u2019s not her fault when Democrats lose at the polls, either. \u201cYou can\u2019t really blame Nancy Pelosi for gerrymandering and for the national election,\u201d Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) told reporters. She\u2019s also the only woman in top House and Senate leadership. If Ryan had replaced her, it would have become all white men. The California Democrat spoke briefly to reporters after the vote, saying she feels \u201cexhilarated\u201d at being re-elected. \u201cToday has a special excitement for me because I think we\u2019re at a time where it is well beyond politics. It\u2019s about the character of America,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cHow we go forward in our caucus to put forth our values, which are what unite us a caucus, to differentiate between us and the administration that will come into Washington in January, to take that message clearly to the public, is something that is a historic challenge.\u201d \u201cWe know how to win elections,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it in the past. We will do it again by making that differentiation.\u201d Asked about the 63 Democrats who voted for Ryan, Pelosi said, \u201cI got two-thirds of the vote.\u201d Separately, Ryan told reporters the race didn\u2019t turn out as he wanted but he thinks he did \u201ca pretty good job\u201d of bringing economic issues to the forefront. \u201cI think we got the message out,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in my heart, if we\u2019re going to win as Democrats, we have to have the kind of message that resonates in every corner of this country.\u201d During the closed-door caucus meeting, several Democrats went to bat for Pelosi. Reps. Adam Schiff (Calif.), Gwen Moore (Wis.), Bill Pascrell (N.J.), Katherine Clark (Mass.), Joaquin Castro (Texas) and Debbie Dingell (Mich.) each gave nominating speeches for her. \u201cEverything we care about [is] at risk,\u201d Schiff told the room. \u201cWe need the very best to lead us. No one is a better tactician than Nancy Pelosi. No one does it better. No one even comes close.\u201d Dingell said she has spoken \u201cendlessly\u201d to Pelosi about appealing to Midwestern voters, and said she gets it. \u201cLeader Pelosi always listened and she always understood.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s understanding of Midwesterners, or lack thereof, is what Ryan highlighted as the party\u2019s biggest problem. He said the California progressive has lost the connection with working-class people in the Midwest \u2015 the same people who make up his district, and the same people who turned out in droves to vote for Trump and help defeat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton weeks ago. \u201cWhen you see working-class people, blue-collar people, going and voting for Trump, that\u2019s a failure of the Democratic Party because they felt like we didn\u2019t care about them,\u201d Ryan said earlier this month. \u201cThat just makes my stomach sick.\u201d Pelosi did not agree with Ryan\u2019s assessment in a Monday interview with The Huffington Post. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even carry his district for Hillary Clinton, so I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s saying that,\u201d she said. \u201cI have strong support from our friends in the unions, including steelworkers, which I guess are his area ...

According to the Times, Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner, Heather Poe, in Washington, DC last year, took to Facebook to rebuke her sister's remarks. \u201cFor the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage,\" she wrote. \"Freedom means freedom for everyone,\" she continued. \"That means that all families \u2014 regardless of how they look or how they are made \u2014 all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other.\" On Friday, Liz Cheney issued a statement voicing her opposition to same-sex marriage. \"I am strongly pro-life and I am not pro-gay marriage,\" she said. \u201cI believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states, and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.\" The elder Cheney daughter is challenging Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) in next year's Republican primary. Previously, she had spoken out against the military's former \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. According to The Hill, Cheney sought to clarify her position after an alleged poll in Wyoming said she \"supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage.\" Her opposition also puts her at odds with her father, who offered support for gay marriage in 2009. \"I think that freedom means freedom for everyone,\" the former vice president said. \"As many of you know, one of my daughters is gay and it is something we have lived with for a long time in our family. I think people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish.\"",

        "body": " Democrats want access to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election before President Donald Trump has a chance to interfere. In a joint letter from the chairs of six committees in the U.S. House of Representatives, Democrats wrote they expect Attorney General William Barr to make Mueller\u2019s report public immediately. \u201cAfter nearly two years of investigation \u2014 accompanied by two years of unprecedented attacks on the integrity of the investigation by President Trump \u2014 the public and Congress are entitled to know what the Special Counsel has found,\u201d the letter urged. Its signatories include House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), oversight committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) Earlier, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) released a statement immediately after the Mueller report was revealed to be complete, demanding that Barr quickly put together a redacted, releasable version for Congress to access. Warner said in a statement: \u201cCongress and the American people deserve to judge the facts for themselves. The Special Counsel\u2019s report must be provided to Congress immediately, and the Attorney General should swiftly prepare a declassified version of the report for the public. Nothing short of that will suffice. It is also critical that all documents related to the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation be preserved and made available to the appropriate Congressional committees. Any attempt by the Trump Administration to cover up the results of this investigation into Russia\u2019s attack on our democracy would be unacceptable.\u201d He joined a number of other Democrats, including several 2020 presidential candidates, who either had statements prepared or tweeted about a prompt release. \u201cThe American people deserve to know the full truth about Russia\u2019s interference in our democracy,\u201d tweeted former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said that the report should be released \u201cwithout delay,\u201d and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) released a joint statement in agreement. They, like Warner, didn\u2019t want Trump to throw a wrench in Congress\u2019 spokes by getting early access to the documents. \u201cAttorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any \u2018sneak preview\u2019 of Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public,\u201d the joint statement said. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, echoed Trump\u2019s own earlier call to release the report. Meanwhile, CNN reports that the \u201cprincipal conclusion\u201d of the report, which the attorney general will soon give to Congress, is expected to be made public. Trump\u2019s camp wasn\u2019t champing at the bit. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the Attorney General pursuant to the regulations. Attorney General Barr will determine the appropriate next steps,\u201d said the president\u2019s personal attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow in a joint statement.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats on Wednesday rejected appeals that they need new leaders to win back disaffected voters, re-electing Representative Nancy Pelosi of California to an eighth term as House leader over a Rust Belt congressman who said the party had lost its connection to the American working class. Ms. Pelosi\u2019s victory over Representative Tim Ryan, a 43-year-old congressman from a blue-collar district anchored in Youngstown, Ohio, ensures that the party will be led in the next Congress by the established \u201ccoastal\u201d Democrats who have increasingly defined it \u2014 Ms. Pelosi, 76, who represents San Francisco, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, 66, who has held various leadership posts since 2005. The leadership elections, conducted by secret ballot behind closed doors, stamped out calls for new leaders. But while Ms. Pelosi won, 134 to 63, Mr. Ryan\u2019s significant share of the total served as a measure of internal discontent and in some ways a repudiation of Ms. Pelosi\u2019s leadership. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of soul-searching,\u201d said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York. \u201cAnd a lot of really wanting to have a plan.\u201d For years, support for Ms. Pelosi has run so deep that few would even consider challenging her. In 2010, after a wave of Tea Party Republicans swept Democrats out of power, she lost just 43 votes. Ms. Pelosi, whose victory was mockingly cheered by Republicans as good news for them, dismissed the idea that House Democrats could no longer win with her at the helm. And she vowed that Democrats would continue to stand as a foil to President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s administration. \u201cWe know how to win elections,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it in the past. We will do it again by making that differentiation.\u201d Representative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, who backed Mr. Ryan, said after the vote that unless Democrats changed course and adopted \u201ca working man and woman\u2019s agenda,\u201d they should expect defeat. \u201cI\u2019m very worried we just signed the Democratic Party\u2019s death certificate for the next decade and a half,\u201d Mr. Schrader said. Democrats also re-elected Representative Steny H. Hoyer, 77, of Maryland as whip, the No. 2 position, as well as Representative James E. Clyburn, 76, of South Carolina in the No. 3 spot as the assistant Democratic leader. Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Clyburn have been part of the Democratic leadership team since 2003 and 2007. Both ran unopposed. Representative Joseph Crowley of New York was also elected chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, and in a narrow victory, 98 to 96, Representative Linda T. S\u00e1nchez of California defeated another California Democrat, Representative Barbara Lee, to become vice chairwoman. After a dismal Election Day for Democrats, the fight for Ms. Pelosi\u2019s post had become a proxy battle for the future of the party, with House Democrats agonizing over how to reconnect with the working-class voters who abandoned them. \u201cWe got wiped out in the Midwest, and we\u2019re toxic in rural America,\u201d aides said Mr. Ryan told his colleagues behind closed doors before the vote. \u201cUltimately, we\u2019re responsible.\u201d But in an interview Tuesday, Mr. Ryan suggested few ideas for how to appeal to voters beyond essentially crowdsourcing the task to more House Democrats, and he offered no indication that working with the Republican majority on any particular policy compromises would be a priority. The Democratic leaders seemed short on concrete strategies, too, committing generally to refocus their message on economic issues. Many also vowed to stand in opposition to the Trump administration, gambling that Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans would disappoint voters and prompt a return to the Democratic Party they rejected. Some of the more specific strategies considered included starting a more aggressive recruitment campaign for Democratic candidates from more conservative areas, as well as increasing their outreach to traditionally \u201cred\u201d districts. \u201cJust because you\u2019re only getting 30 percent of the vote in some area doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t go there,\u201d said Representative Cedric L. Richmond of Louisiana. \u201cYou should go there and engage people and tell them what you believe in.\u201d Disappointed by the outcome of the leadership election, a handful of Democrats who had backed Mr. Ryan vowed to press forward with a proposal to turn some jobs, such as the chairman of the party\u2019s campaign arm, into elected positions. That plan is expected to meet resistance from Ms. Pelosi, who retains the power to appoint people to those positions, though some Democrats have expressed an interest in the idea. Last week Ms. Pelosi selected Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico to again lead the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, even though House Democrats picked up just six seats in this election. Though he collected only a dozen or so public endorsements, Mr. Ryan mounted an unlikely challenge to Ms. Pelosi, long considered a legislative and fund-raising powerhouse. Driven by the conviction that Democrats need a new leader, he tried to harness discontent with a leadership team that has failed three times to reclaim the majority since being swept out in 2010. Trying to quell calls to replace her, Ms. Pelosi announced her nominations last week for a handful of other positions, and proposed that three members from Illinois, Pennsylvania and New York share the leadership duties of the party\u2019s messaging committee, offering more regional diversity. She also released plans to incorporate more junior members into leadership roles, among other ideas, such as including a freshman Democrat in the leadership team\u2019s regular meetings. But each new idea has underscored the fact that Ms. Pelosi refuses to relinquish much power and has cultivated a large, loyal following that does not expect her to. It is from that sizable collection of House Democrats that she draws her picks for smaller leadership posts, making her a powerful ally and, for those like Mr. Ryan who have challenged her, a formidable opponent. \u201cShe has a lot of friends,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThis is her caucus, clearly.\u201d",

        "body": " President Trump thinks Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore \u201cwill do the right thing and step aside\u201d if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true, the White House said in a statement Thursday. Speaking to reporters following the president\u2019s Asia trip on Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also cautioned against a rush to judgment. \u201cLike most Americans, the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a person\u2019s life,\" Sanders said. \"However, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.\" Moore lashed out earlier at what he called \"the Obama-Clinton machine's liberal media lapdogs\" after The Washington Post reported on a woman's claims that the former judge and staunch social conservative initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14. In a series of tweets Thursday evening, Moore claimed \"The forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal \u2013\u2013 even inflict physical harm \u2013\u2013 if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives.\" Amid calls for him to drop out of the race, Moore added, \"Our nation is at a crossroads right now \u2014 both spiritually and politically. Our children and grandchildren\u2019s futures are on the line. So rest assured \u2014 I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!\" The Post story centered on allegations made by Leigh Corfman, now 53. She told the newspaper that Moore, then an assistant district attorney, first approached her in 1979 outside a courtroom in Alabama where she was sitting with her mother. On another occasion, she said Moore, then 32, took her to his home in the woods and kissed her. During a subsequent visit, Corfman reportedly claimed he took off her shirt and pants; touched her over her bra and underwear; and guided her hand to his underwear. She said the two did not have sexual intercourse, and that she ended up getting dressed and asking Moore to take her home, according to the Post. \u201cI wanted it over with \u2013 I wanted out,\u201d she told the Post, apparently recalling her train of thought at the time. Moore did take her home, she said. The report caused immediate problems for Moore with his own party as he heads into the Dec. 12 election against Democrat Doug Jones. Several GOP senators called on him to step aside if the allegations are true \u2013 and at least one senator, Arizona\u2019s John McCain, said he should drop out regardless. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who backed Moore\u2019s rival Luther Strange in the GOP primary, said in a statement: \"If these allegations are true, he must step aside.\" Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., head of the Senate GOP campaign arm, called the allegations \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and said: \u201cIf these allegations are found to be true, Roy Moore must drop out of the Alabama special Senate election.\u201d Jones\u2019 campaign told multiple news outlets: \u201cRoy Moore needs to answer these serious charges.\u201d But Moore\u2019s campaign issued a statement saying the report is \u201cbaseless\u201d and false. \u201cNational liberal organizations know their chosen candidate Doug Jones is in a death spiral, and this is their last ditch Hail Mary,\u201d Moore campaign chairman Bill Armistead said. \u201cJudge Roy Moore is winning with a double-digit lead. So it is no surprise, with just over four weeks remaining, in a race for the U.S. Senate with national implications, that the Democratic Party and the country\u2019s most liberal newspaper would come up with a fabrication of this kind. \u201cThis garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation,\u201d he said. The Post noted that the legal age of consent in the state is 16, and sexual contact by anyone 19 or older with anyone between 12 and 16 years old is considered second-degree sexual abuse. The statute of limitations, though, has long since passed. The Post interviewed three other women who were teenagers at the time who claimed Moore pursued them when he was in his 30s, though he did not force them into any type of sexual relationship. \u201cI have prayed over this,\u201d Corfman told the Post as to why she came forward, \u201cAll I know is that I can\u2019t sit back and let this continue, let him continue without the mask being removed.\u201d Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, responded: \u201cThese allegations are deeply disturbing. I will hold judgment until we know the facts. The people of Alabama deserve to know the truth and will make their own decisions.\u201d",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 As State Department lawyers sifted last summer through a new batch of documents related to the Benghazi attacks, they repeatedly saw something that caught their attention: emails sent to and from a personal account for Hillary Rodham Clinton. The lawyers, according to current and former State Department officials, were working to respond to a request from a specially appointed House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Libya. But they noticed that among the 15,000 documents they examined, there were no emails to or from an official departmental account for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cThis all raised the question to us: What else are we missing, and what do we need to comply\u201d with the request, said one official briefed on the matter. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s spokesman and the State Department have cast her decision to hand over her emails as motivated by efforts to update the department\u2019s record management system. \u201cWhen the department asked former secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes,\u201d Nick Merrill, the Clinton spokesman, said on Sunday. But it was the review of Benghazi-related documents last summer that, within the State Department, set off the chain of events leading to the public disclosure this week of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email account, according to the current and former department officials. The decision to ask Mrs. Clinton for her emails went all the way to Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s chief of staff, who, along with officials working on the response to the Benghazi requests, signed off on it. Beginning in August, senior State Department officials held negotiations with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lawyers and advisers to gain access to her personal email records. At one point, her advisers met face-to-face with department officials in Washington. In October, the State Department sent a letter to Mrs. Clinton and all former secretaries of state back to Madeleine K. Albright, seeking emails and other documents in their possession that related to their government work. Finally, in December, dozens of boxes filled with 50,000 pages of printed emails from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s personal account were delivered to the State Department. Those documents were then examined by department lawyers, who found roughly 900 pages pertaining to the Benghazi attacks. Three weeks ago, the State Department handed over the Benghazi emails to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which is led by Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s spokesman, Mr. Merrill, did not respond to an email seeking comment. A senior State Department official said, \u201cIt would be oversimplified and inaccurate to draw the conclusion that the preservation of her records was done for one purpose.\u201d Late Wednesday night, two days after The New York Times first reported that she had exclusively used a personal email account as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton announced that she had asked the State Department to release those communications. \u201cI want the public to see my email,\u201d Mrs. Clinton wrote in a Twitter post shortly before midnight, addressing the issue publicly for the first time. \u201cI asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s decision leaves it to the State Department to determine whether parts of her correspondence should be redacted if they contain information that could be damaging to national security, or for other reasons. That process could take several months, officials said, because different parts of the State Department must weigh in on whether information should be redacted. Other government agencies, like the C.I.A. and the Defense Department, may also need to be consulted on any information related to them. While the State Department has said there does not appear to be any classified material in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, officials said on Thursday that they needed to go through the trove again to determine whether it contained any \u201csensitive\u201d information. Sensitive information is different from classified information. It can be personal data, like Social Security numbers, or information on matters that other countries consider classified or important to their national security. One State Department official said that if many lawyers were dedicated to the project, it could be completed in several weeks. Since the disclosure that Mrs. Clinton used the private account, a spokeswoman for the State Department has described the request from Mrs. Clinton as part of the department\u2019s larger efforts to improve its record-keeping. The spokeswoman, Marie Harf, was asked on Tuesday whether there was any connection between the requests from Congress and the decision to ask the former secretaries of state for emails from their personal accounts. \u201cThe letter actually went before we got the request from the select committee,\u201d Ms. Harf said of the request to the former secretaries. \u201cIt went in October of 2014 \u2014 that was before we had gotten a request from the committee \u2014 as part of our records-maintenance upgrading and the process we go through.\u201d Ms. Harf said that Mrs. Clinton was the only secretary of state who had sent back copies of emails.",

        "body": " President Trump said Friday he is declaring a national emergency on the southern border, tapping into executive powers in a bid to divert billions toward construction of a wall even as he signs a funding package that includes just $1.4 billion for border security. \u201cWe\u2019re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border \u2026 one way or the other, we have to do it,\u201d Trump said in the Rose Garden. The move is expected to face a swift and forceful legal challenge that could stall the attempt in the courts for the near future. But the declaration and other money-moving plans allow Trump to continue to fight for border wall construction while also averting another partial government shutdown -- which would have been triggered at midnight absent the new funding package. He signed the spending deal Friday afternoon. Trump, in the Rose Garden, declared once again that \"walls work\" as he confirmed the emergency declaration would accompany the spending legislation. \"We\u2019re talking about an invasion of our country,\" Trump said. And in an almost-casual tone, the president predicted a legal fight that will wind up before the Supreme Court. \"We will have a national emergency, and we will then be sued,\" Trump said, adding that the federal appeals courts could well rule against his administration. \"Then we\u2019ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we\u2019ll get a fair shake, and we\u2019ll win at the Supreme Court -- just like the [travel] ban.\u201d A senior administration official told Fox News that the White House plans to move $8 billion in currently appropriated or available funds toward construction of the wall. Of that, $3 billion could be diverted with help from the emergency declaration. That money includes about $600 million from the Treasury Department\u2019s forfeiture fund. That money has been described as \u201ceasy money\u201d that the White House can use however it wants. The White House is also expected to use drug interdiction money from the Department of Defense. But by declaring an emergency, Trump would also seek to unlock money from the Defense Department\u2019s military construction budget, to the tune of $3.5 billion. Diverting Pentagon funding, however, is expected to set off a legal battle and has already prompted fierce opposition from Democrats in Congress. \"This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed President, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \"The President's actions clearly violate the Congress\u2019s exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution.\" They vowed Congress would \"defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.\" \"The President\u2019s declaration of a national emergency would be an abuse of his constitutional oath and an affront to the separation of powers. Congress has the exclusive power of the purse, and the Constitution specifically prohibits the President from spending money that has not been appropriated. ... This is a gross abuse of power that cannot be tolerated,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement. This is far from the only declared national emergency. According to the Congressional Research Service, there are at least 30 \"national emergencies\" in effect, including those concerning blocking Iranian government property, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other terror-related acts. But none of the emergencies have involved the president of the United States spending money that had not been specifically appropriated by Congress. The president\u2019s decision to declare a national emergency comes after a review of the spending package. The compromise package, which was negotiated for weeks in a bipartisan conference committee, passed both the House and the Senate on Thursday. But the deal would provide only a fraction of Trump\u2019s originally proposed figure of $5.7 billion for border security and construction of a wall or physical barrier along the southern border. The bill also imposed a number of restrictions on the White House, with legislative language preventing the administration from moving funding around to get a barrier or a wall -- a factor that may have contributed to the emergency declaration decision. The package, as it stands, is enough to build just 55 miles of barrier. And notably, the word \"wall\" does not appear once in the 1,768 pages of legislation and explanatory materials. The funding battle follows the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. From Dec. 22 through Jan. 25\u2014for 35 days\u2014the White House and congressional Democrats battled over border security funding. Trump requested $5.7 billion for construction of the wall, while Democrats vowed to block any spending proposal that included such funding. The shutdown left more than 800,000 federal employees and contractors furloughed or working without pay. At the end of last month, though, Trump signed a short-term spending package that funded the government through the Friday deadline. The prior fight left little appetite on either side of the aisle for another shutdown, leading to the passage Thursday of the compromise measure. Trump, though, has talked for weeks about taking executive action to divert money from other programs for wall construction, without congressional sign-off\u2014despite his criticisms of former President Barack Obama for using executive action.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The chairman of the House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks asked Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday to appear for a private interview about her exclusive use of a personal email account when she was secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cemail arrangement with herself is highly unusual, if not unprecedented,\u201d the committee\u2019s chairman, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, wrote in a letter to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lawyer Tuesday morning. He added that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s disclosure last week that all of the emails from the personal account had been deleted \u201conly exacerbates our need to better understand what the secretary did, when she did it and why she did it.\u201d The emails were on a server at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y. Mr. Gowdy had asked Mrs. Clinton to turn over that server to a neutral third party, like the State Department\u2019s inspector general, to determine which emails were personal and which were government records. But in a letter to Mr. Gowdy on Friday, a lawyer for Mrs. Clinton said there was no need to turn over the server because an examination of it showed that it had no copies of emails she sent during her time as secretary of state. In October, the State Department asked former secretaries of state dating back to Madeleine Albright to provide it with any government records \u2014 like emails \u2014 they might have in their possession. The lawyer for Mrs. Clinton, David Kendall, said that in response to that request, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s representatives had determined which of her roughly 60,000 emails were personal and private. Then, he said, a setting on the email account was changed to retain only messages sent in the previous two months. Since the report by The New York Times on March 2 that Mrs. Clinton used only a personal email account and did not even have a government account, she seems to have provided two answers about whether she still has copies of her emails. At a news conference at the United Nations a little more than a week after The Times\u2019s report, Mrs. Clinton first said she \u201cchose not to keep\u201d her private personal emails. But she then said that the server, which contained personal communications of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, \u201cwill remain private.\u201d Mr. Gowdy said the committee believed that \u201ca transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clinton\u2019s privacy, the security of the information queried and the public\u2019s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it.\u201d But Mrs. Clinton indicated on Tuesday that she wanted to give her testimony in a public setting. In a written statement, a spokesman for her said she had told the committee months ago that she was prepared to testify at a public hearing. \u201cIt is by their choice that hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d said the spokesman, Nick Merrill. \u201cTo be clear, she remains ready to appear at a hearing open to the American public.\u201d The committee\u2019s ranking member, Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, said the panel should hold a public hearing instead of a private interview. \u201cRather than drag out this political charade into 2016 and selectively leak portions of a closed-door interview, the committee should schedule the public hearing, make her records public and refocus its efforts on the attacks in Benghazi,\u201d he said. Mr. Gowdy has sought to prevent his inquiry into the attacks in 2012 on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya \u2014 and its burgeoning examination of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices \u2014 from being dismissed as a strictly partisan effort to embarrass a likely Democratic nominee for president.

        "body": " DENVER \u2014 Two heartland states filed the first major court challenge to marijuana legalization on Thursday, saying that Colorado\u2019s growing array of state-regulated recreational marijuana shops was piping marijuana into neighboring states and should be shut down. The lawsuit was brought by attorneys general in Nebraska and Oklahoma, and asks the United States Supreme Court to strike down key parts of a 2012 voter-approved measure that legalized marijuana in Colorado for adult use and created a new system of stores, taxes and regulations surrounding retail marijuana. While marijuana remains illegal under federal law, officials have largely allowed Colorado and other states to move ahead with state-run programs allowing medical and recreational marijuana. But the lawsuit from Nebraska and Oklahoma, where marijuana is still outlawed, argues that Colorado has \u201ccreated a dangerous gap\u201d in the federal drug-control system. \u201cMarijuana flows from this gap into neighboring states,\u201d the suit says, undermining their marijuana bans, \u201cdraining their treasuries, and placing stress on their criminal justice systems.\u201d For months, some sheriffs and police officers in rural counties bordering Colorado have complained that they have seen more marijuana entering their towns and being transported down their highways since recreational sales began in January. Oklahoma and Nebraska said the influx had led to more arrests, more impounded vehicles and higher jail and court costs. They say it has also forced law-enforcement agencies to spend more time and dedicate more resources to handling marijuana-related arrests. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of marijuana coming over from Colorado,\u201d said Sheriff Adam Hayward of Deuel County, Neb., who said that he was gratified that the two states were challenging Colorado\u2019s marijuana laws. He has complained that marijuana arrests have strained his jail budget. \u201cFor the longest time we were saying, this is becoming a problem for us.\u201d Colorado\u2019s attorney general, John Suthers, a Republican, said in a statement that the challenge from Nebraska and Oklahoma was \u201cwithout merit.\u201d Like many elected officials in Colorado, Mr. Suthers had opposed Amendment 64, which legalized marijuana. But on Thursday, he said \u201cwe will vigorously defend\u201d against the lawsuit attempting to undo it. Nebraska and Oklahoma\u2019s challenge is aimed more at the commercial side of marijuana legalization, which created new systems of regulations and taxes as well as recreational stores, dispensaries and production facilities that are monitored and licensed by state officials. The suit does not specifically seek to overturn the portion of Amendment 64 that made marijuana legal for personal use and possession, meaning that portions of legalization could survive even if Nebraska and Oklahoma prevail. But marijuana advocates said that the challenge \u2014 if it succeeds at shutting down marijuana retailers \u2014 could boost the black market. \u201cIf Nebraska and Oklahoma succeed, they will put the violent criminal organizations back in charge,\u201d Michael Elliott, the executive director of the Marijuana Industry Group, a Colorado-based trade group, said in a statement. The lawsuit, which was brought by Nebraska\u2019s attorney general, Jon Bruning, and Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, Scott Pruitt, accused Colorado officials of participating in a \u201cscheme\u201d that cultivates, packages and distributes marijuana in direct violation of controlled-substances laws while \u201cignoring every objective embodied in the federal drug control regulation.\u201d It was filed directly with the Supreme Court because it involves a dispute among states. \u201cThe Constitution and the federal antidrug laws do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local pro-drug policies and licensed distribution schemes throughout the country,\u201d the lawsuit says. Nebraska and Oklahoma accused Colorado of leaving huge holes in marijuana rules that allowed the plant to flow out of state. While it is against the law to take legally purchased marijuana across state lines, Nebraska and Oklahoma said that Colorado does not require consumers to smoke or eat their marijuana where they buy it, and said that despite purchasing and possession limits, anyone can easily visit several dispensaries and stock up. Some sheriffs in bordering states say they have pulled over drivers and found edibles and marijuana from multiple Colorado retail outlets. They also criticized Colorado for not tracking marijuana once it is sold, and for not requiring marijuana buyers to undergo criminal background checks (under Colorado law, anyone 21 or older can legally purchase recreational marijuana). Colorado\u2019s rules have no way to prevent \u201ccriminal enterprises, gangs and cartels from acquiring marijuana inventory directly from retail marijuana stores,\u201d the lawsuit says. Nebraska and Oklahoma complained about a \u201csignificant influx of Colorado-sourced marijuana,\u201d but the suit did not mention specific statistics about Colorado-related marijuana arrests or drug seizures. In earlier interviews, some local law-enforcement officers along Colorado\u2019s borders said that they had not seen an increase in marijuana coming from Colorado.",

        "body": " Prominent Republicans are calling for Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service over religious beliefs. The Republican governor returned home Tuesday afternoon to a political climate that is much different from just a week ago when she left for Washington the last five days for a governor's conference. The Arizona Legislature passed a bill last week allowing businesses whose owners cite sincerely held religious beliefs to deny service to gays. It allows any business, church or person to cite the law as a defense in any action brought by the government or individual claiming discrimination. The legislation has caused a national uproar. The chorus of opposition has grown each day, with the business community, the state's Super Bowl Committee and both Republican U.S. senators calling for a veto. Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney was the latest prominent voice to weigh in and urge Brewer to veto the bill. Brewer will likely spend the next day or more pondering Senate Bill 1062 before deciding whether to sign or veto the legislation. There is widespread speculation that Brewer will veto the bill, but she has not said how she'll act, as is her longtime practice with pending legislation. Political observers in Arizona cautioned that the governor is deliberate and not prone to act hastily, despite the growing calls from business, politicians of all stripes, and civil rights groups for a veto. \"She's no rookie to these high-profile deals \u2014 she gives both sides their due,\" said Doug Cole, a political consultant whose firm has run all of Brewer's campaigns for decades. \"She's going to get a very detailed briefing from her legal team, and give the proponents their best shot, and the opponents their best shot,\" he said. \"Everybody's going to get their say, and they've giving it.\" Some Republican senators who pushed the bill through the Legislature are now calling for a veto as well, but they cite \"inaccurate\" information about the measure for igniting a firestorm. They argue the bill is designed only to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits that have happened in other states. Some blame the media for blowing the law out of proportion. Democrats say that argument doesn't wash and call SB1062 \"toxic\" legislation that allows discrimination. They said they warned Republicans who voted for the bill that it was destined for trouble. \"We brought this to their attention five weeks ago,\" said Sen. Steve Gallardo, D-Phoenix. \"We said this is exactly what is going to happen. You have a bill here that's so toxic it's going to divide this Legislature. It's going to be polarizing the entire state. And that's exactly what happened.\" The bill was pushed by the Center for Arizona Policy, a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage. The group says the proposal simply clarifies existing state law and is needed to protect against increasingly activist federal courts. The center's president, Cathi Herrod, has been deriding what she called \"fear-mongering\" from the measure's opponents. \"What's happened is our opponents have employed a new political tactic, and it's working,\" she said. \"Throw out the threat of a boycott to attempt to defeat a bill, and you might just be able to be successful. Herrod added she was surprised and disappointed that \"in America today, false attacks and irresponsible characterizations about a piece of legislation can so intimidate and persuade people to change their opinion about religious liberty.\"",

Mark Sheridan, the attorney representing Christie's campaign, confirmed to Fox News that the campaign and the Republican State Committee received subpoenas relating to the closure of traffic lanes near the George Washington Bridge last year. \"We can confirm that the Christie for Governor re-election campaign and the New Jersey Republican State Committee received subpoenas for documents from the U.S. Attorney's office, in addition to the subpoena the campaign previously received from the state legislative committee,\" he said. \"All three subpoenas focus on the closure of lanes on the George Washington Bridge.

Sheridan works for the firm and is general counsel for the state Republican committee. A state legislative committee investigating the traffic jams has also issued subpoenas to the two organizations. The federal subpoenas are due Feb. 5. The state committee subpoenas must be returned Feb. 3. Earlier this month, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said only that his office was reviewing the matter \"to determine whether a federal law was implicated.\" The traffic lanes were closed for four days in September, creating traffic gridlock in Fort Lee, the town at the base of the bridge on the New Jersey side.

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democrats on Thursday vowed to filibuster the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, signaling an imminent partisan showdown over the nominee\u2019s fate and the future of century-old rules in the chamber. As committee hearings on Judge Gorsuch concluded on Thursday, it appeared increasingly likely that Republicans hoping to elevate President Trump\u2019s choice for the court would resort to replacing longstanding rules with a simple majority vote on his confirmation. While a parade of witnesses addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee, trading dueling views of Judge Gorsuch, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, went to the Senate floor and announced that he would try to lead Democrats in blocking an up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch. The Senate\u2019s \u201ccloture\u201d rule requires a supermajority of 60 votes to overcome such a filibuster. \u201cAfter careful deliberation I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court,\u201d Mr. Schumer said, citing concerns over Judge Gorsuch\u2019s record on workers\u2019 rights and his degree of independence, adding, \u201cMy vote will be no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\u201d Judge Gorsuch must earn the support of at least eight Democrats to break a filibuster \u2014 a threshold he is not on track to meet, at least so far, according to interviews and internal party discussions. If Democrats band together, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has threatened to pursue the so-called nuclear option eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court selections. Mr. Trump has urged Mr. McConnell to take that step if necessary. Some Republicans have expressed reservations about changing the rules, but Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Thursday that he would relent if it meant seating Judge Gorsuch. \u201cWhatever it takes to get him on the court, I will do,\u201d Mr. Graham told \u201cThe Mike Gallagher Show\u201d radio program. Mr. McConnell has said he wants the Senate to confirm Judge Gorsuch to fill the vacancy, which was created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia more than a year ago, before departing for a scheduled recess on April 7. Last year, Mr. McConnell led his party in refusing to consider President Obama\u2019s choice for the seat, Judge Merrick B. Garland, during a presidential election campaign. On Thursday, Mr. McConnell accused Democrats of engaging in \u201cobstructionist tactics\u201d to block a well-qualified nominee. \u201cDespite the judge\u2019s outstanding performance, his exceptional background, and the extensive support he\u2019s received from people of all political leanings, we know that some Senate Democrats will continue trying to come up with any reason to delay the confirmation process,\u201d Mr. McConnell said of Judge Gorsuch. During the four days of hearings, even Judge Gorsuch\u2019s critics did not dispute his credentials. On Thursday, representatives of the American Bar Association told the committee that it had unanimously found Judge Gorsuch to be \u201cwell qualified,\u201d the group\u2019s highest rating. That was particularly notable in light of studies that have shown the group has tended to favor the nominees of Democratic presidents. \u201cWe do not give the \u2018well qualified\u2019 rating lightly,\u201d said Nancy Scott Degan, an official of the bar association. The group had also given its highest rating to Judge Garland. Since the evening Judge Gorsuch was nominated, liberal groups have been pressuring Democrats to filibuster the vote on him. Four years ago, when Democrats controlled the Senate and Republican senators were blockading Mr. Obama\u2019s appeals court and executive branch nominees, Democrats changed the chamber\u2019s rules to bar filibusters for such positions \u2014 but left the filibuster rule in place for Supreme Court nominations. Republicans have cited this history often in accusing their colleagues of hypocrisy on Judge Gorsuch. To eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, Republicans would need to vote in virtual lock step: The party effectively has only 51 votes right now because one member, Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, is recuperating from back surgery, so just two Republican senators could block a rules change. Still, Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination is broadly popular among conservatives. The question facing Democrats is whether to have a filibuster fight over Judge Gorsuch, highlighting what they consider the theft of a seat they believe Mr. Obama had a right to fill, or whether to save that attention-grabbing tactic for a hypothetical future vacancy if a more liberal justice dies or steps down and President Trump nominates a staunch conservative who would shift the court\u2019s balance. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should move forward on the Gorsuch nomination until the nomination of Merrick Garland has been dealt with fairly,\u201d Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, said on Thursday, signaling his support for a filibuster. Another moderate Democrat, Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, also said he would reject Judge Gorsuch and join the filibuster effort. Mr. Casey is among the 10 Democrats facing re-election next year in states that Mr. Trump won. Others in the group were less eager to declare their intentions. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep on my theme I\u2019ve been on for a couple of months,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about Gorsuch.\u201d Even before Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination, Ms. McCaskill inadvertently drew the ire of liberal activists by expressing support for \u201ca full confirmation hearing process and a vote,\u201d before making clear she believed in a 60-vote threshold. Despite the escalating political friction, the atmosphere in the hearing room on Thursday was often more perfunctory than passionate, as panels of witnesses selected by Democrats and Republicans alternately expressed concerns that Judge Gorsuch was too conservative or praised him as a well-qualified and careful judge. Two of Judge Gorsuch\u2019s former colleagues on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver \u2014 Deanell Reece Tacha, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, and Robert Harlan Henry, appointed by President Bill Clinton \u2014 praised his intellect and temperament. But others expressed concerns. One strain of criticism came from human rights and civil liberties activists, who expressed alarm over Judge Gorsuch\u2019s experiences as a Justice Department official in the Bush administration in 2005 and 2006, when he helped to defend and advance the executive branch\u2019s positions on matters like detainee treatment and surveillance. Jameel Jaffer, who litigated national-security cases against the government as the former deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, urged the committee to scrutinize more closely Judge Gorsuch\u2019s views on executive power and individual rights. Mr. Jaffer pointed to documents showing, for example, that Judge Gorsuch had worked to get Congress to enact a law stripping courts of jurisdiction to hear lawsuits by Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees, and in one email chain he criticized law firms that helped represent prisoners in seeking judicial review of their detention. On Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch told the committee that the email had not been \u201cmy finest moment\u201d and that he had been \u201cblowing off steam with a friend, privately.\u201d",

The chalkboard, a prop that he uses frequently on his top-rated show, brought the audience to its feet. Beck wrote \"Progressivism\" on it to underscore his belief in what America is suffering from. When Beck asked what America is suffering from, someone shouted \"President Obama,\" though Beck, an outspoken critic of the president, said it's \"not that simple.\" Beck rejected the notion that the Republican Party should expand its tent to include progressives. \"What is this? A circus?\" he said, drawing laughter. \"America is not a clown show. America is an idea that sets people free.\" Opening up about his troubled past, Beck told the crowd, \"People need to understand that life is not fair. The bad guy sometimes wins.\" The speech capped three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers, including numerous politicians mentioned as contenders for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. But for a lot of the CPAC attendees, Beck was the reason they came, as he is seen as a leader in the new conservative movement. The speech comes after a year in which Beck's growing popularity as a Fox News host coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist rage directed at Washington. Beck also launched the 9/12 Project, which sets forth nine values and 12 principles that he believes the country was founded upon. The project inspired a major march in Washington in September. \"This is how is America should be,\" said Cynthia Burgiss, 22, a student at the University of Dayton in Ohio who attended the 9/12 march in D.C. this year. \"People of every race, political affiliation, religion came together for different reasons.\" She was at CPAC to see Beck and called him a \"relatable ... everyday guy.\" \"None of this would have happened without Glenn,\" she said.",

LePage, the embattled Republican governor of Maine, declared on Wednesday that he would not step down despite widespread criticism over a profane threat and generalizations about drugs and race that had prompted him to hint on Tuesday that he might abort his second term. \u201cI will not resign,\u201d said Mr. LePage, who tried to put to rest swirling questions about his state of mind. \u201cI\u2019m not an alcoholic, and I\u2019m not a drug addict, and I don\u2019t have mental issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I have is a backbone.\u201d Mr. LePage nevertheless said he was seeking \u201cspiritual guidance,\u201d had apologized for his threat, and vowed to make one change to his behavior: \u201cI will no longer speak to the press ever again after today,\u201d he said. Behind the scenes, state lawmakers \u2014 Democrats and Senate Republicans \u2014 exasperated after six years of political controversies and what they saw as erratic behavior, were scrambling to figure out what, if anything, they could do to formally address this latest crisis. The controversy, which has galvanized the state, started last Wednesday when Mr. LePage made sweeping statements linking minorities to the state\u2019s drug crisis. As criticism against him swelled, Mr. LePage came to believe that a Democratic lawmaker had called him a racist. The governor then left him an expletive-laden voicemail message, which he followed up by threatening to shoot the lawmaker between the eyes. In the ensuing days, Mr. LePage also reiterated his insistence that blacks and Hispanics were the vast majority of those arrested for dealing heroin in Maine. Both Democrats and Republicans have denounced the remarks, as many legislators called for a special session to at least rebuke the governor over his latest tirade. The state\u2019s four legislative caucuses have said that they believe all four would have to agree for a special session to be scheduled. But on Tuesday, Mr. LePage\u2019s Republican allies in the House, including the minority leader, Kenneth Fredette, announced that they would oppose those efforts \u2014 essentially shielding him from any official political consequence. That decision did not sit well with some other state Republicans, and on Wednesday morning, the spotlight shifted to them as the president of the Senate, whose members govern larger and more competitive districts, made a public break with his colleagues in the House. \u201cWith all due respect, I completely disagree with Representative Fredette\u2019s position,\u201d the Republican leader, Michael Thibodeau, said in a statement. \u201cThe Republican senate caucus has clearly stated that we need an acceptable plan for corrective action before the determination of whether the Legislature should convene is made.\u201d Mr. Thibodeau said many Senate Republicans were still deciding whether or not Mr. LePage\u2019s apology and promise to seek \u201cspiritual guidance\u201d had allayed their concerns about the governor \u2014 a process that could deepen their divide with Republicans in the House and pull the controversy into a second week. \u201cThere should be consequences for our actions,\u201d Mr. Thibodeau said, \u201cand I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re really struggling.\u201d There is no precedent for such a situation here \u2014 a fact that has sent lawmakers like Senator Roger Katz, a Republican who has been critical of Mr. LePage, back to reading their state Constitutions on Wednesday to figure out what, if anything, they could do now to convene a special session. Mr. Katz, a lawyer, suggested it may require only a simple majority of the House and senate, which could reduce the House Republicans\u2019 ability to block such a move, although he added there could be other hurdles to an agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s never been done before, so we\u2019re in a little bit of uncharted waters,\u201d said Mr. Katz, who said he wanted Mr. LePage to get \u201ca competent evaluation and follow the recommendations of the evaluator.\u201d Democrats have continued to call for Mr. LePage\u2019s ouster, and on Wednesday said they were scheduling meetings with Republican leadership to discuss how to proceed. \u201cComing back in for a special session will be discussed and all options around the governor\u2019s political future are on the table,\u201d said the Democratic leader of the Senate, Justin Alfond. Mr. LePage\u2019s six years in office here, which began as part of the Tea Party sweep in 2010, have been marked by controversy. Even as he fueled outrage among Democrats and angst among many moderate Republicans, his well of support, fed by voters drawn to his unfiltered political style, never seemed to run dry. By all indications, Mr. LePage seemed determined to again ride out the political storm. \u201cI want to put this behind us,\u201d Mr. LePage said, during a meeting with a select group of reporters in his office on Wednesday morning, adding, \u201cI will never talk about it again.\u201d Mr. LePage spoke shortly after he met with \u2014 and apologized to \u2014 Representative Drew Gattine, the state Democratic lawmaker who had been the recipient of the angry voice mail. And in meeting with reporters, Mr. LePage spoke emotionally about Maine\u2019s heroin crisis. But he but did not apologize for statements he made last week that linked trafficking in the drug to blacks and Hispanics. \u201cI didn\u2019t use racially charged language,\u201d Mr. LePage claimed, although he also said, \u201cLet\u2019s leave ethnicity out of it.\u201d",

        "body": " President Donald Trump on Friday declared a national emergency at the southern U.S. border in an effort to unilaterally seize funding to begin building his long-promised wall between the U.S. and Mexico. Trump, who was accompanied by parents of children killed by unauthorized immigrants, said he was declaring the national emergency for \u201cvirtual invasion purposes.\u201d But he also acknowledged another reason: He didn\u2019t want to wait on Congress to approve the funds. \u201cI could do the wall over a longer period of time \u2015 I didn\u2019t need to do this,\u201d Trump said in a televised speech, even as he contended the situation on the southern border amounted to a national emergency. \u201cBut I\u2019d rather do it much faster.\u201d Trump is also expected to approve Congress\u2019 spending bill, which grants him $1.375 billion for the wall, as opposed to the $5.7 billion he initially demanded. The national emergency declaration gives Trump a chance to reroute other government money to fund the project \u2015 and sets up a legal battle that could tie up the president\u2019s signature project for months or years. To justify the wall, Trump repeatedly insisted criminals, gang members and drug traffickers were pouring over the border and that only a wall could stop them. \u201cWe have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably ever before,\u201d Trump said. In fact, arrests for illegal border crossings are at their lowest levels since the 1970s. There were roughly 520,000 arrests for unauthorized border crossings last year, which is about one-third of the 1.6 million arrests that happened in 2000. Since 2014, a high proportion of those crossing have been Central American children and families seeking to make humanitarian claims such as asylum. The total wall funding will now come to about $8 billion, partially approved by Congress but mostly by Trump alone. That will buy the administration some 234 miles of border wall, a senior administration official told reporters Friday. The national emergency declaration will allow the Trump administration to use about $3.6 billion from Defense Department construction projects to build the wall, along with another $2.5 billion the department had allocated for counter-drug activities, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters. The Trump administration also plans to take executive action to move about $200 million from the Department of Homeland Security and another $600 million from the Treasury Department\u2019s asset forfeiture account. None of the money will come from hurricane relief, Mulvaney said. The DHS funding bill included restrictions on where new border wall could be constructed. Those restrictions won\u2019t apply to the portions built with national emergency money, a senior administration official said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Thursday on the Senate floor that Trump planned to sign the bill and declare a national emergency at the same time, adding that he supported the decision. Congress passed a government funding bill Thursday evening. McConnell warned Trump in private that declaring an emergency would spark a backlash among Republicans, according to The Washington Post. A national emergency declaration grants a president the ability to circumvent certain government rules so that an administration can respond to a crisis. In this case, Trump is sidestepping Congress so that he can gain access to certain federal funds without congressional approval. Administration officials cited dozens of previous national emergency declarations, insisting that Trump would not break with historical precedent by \u201cunlocking\u201d new pots of money for the border wall he seeks. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if he just didn\u2019t get what he wanted so he\u2019s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money,\u201d Mulvaney said. The move is almost certain to be challenged in court. \u201cAny crisis on our border is of President Trump\u2019s own making: family separations, child detention, turning our backs on asylum seekers, and more. There is no national emergency,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who has sued the Trump administration multiple times, said in a statement. \u201cIf Trump oversteps his authority and abandons negotiations with Congress by declaring a fabricated national emergency, we won\u2019t only call his bluff, we will do what we must to hold him accountable.\u201d Prior to the declaration, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the proclamation a \u201cgross abuse of the power of the presidency\u201d and vowed that \u201cCongress will defend our constitutional authorities.\u201d For two months, Democrats in Congress have been enmeshed in stalled negotiations with Trump as he refused to accept anything less than $5.7 billion in the federal budget for his border wall. The stalemate caused a record-breaking partial government shutdown that forced an estimated 800,000 government employees to go without pay for 35 days. Trump reopened the government for three weeks on Jan. 25, allowing government workers to get back to work as border security negotiations continued. In January, Trump asserted that he had \u201cthe absolute right to declare a national emergency,\u201d according to CNN. He called it \u201cthe easy route\u201d while insisting that he\u2019d rather Congress approve his border wall funding.",

        "body": " Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday released her most recent eight years of tax returns, showing that she and former President Bill Clinton earned $139 million in adjusted gross income from 2007 to 2014. She also released a list of paid speeches showing that she had earned nearly $10 million in speaking fees in 2013, the year she left the State Department. The spate of voluntary disclosures on Friday, intended to highlight Mrs. Clinton\u2019s efforts at transparency, came after a week of renewed attention to her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Recent polls suggest that the focus on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices has affected the number of voters who see her as \u201chonest\u201d and \u201ctrustworthy.\u201d In a statement, Mrs. Clinton highlighted the millions of dollars she said she and her husband had paid in taxes and given to charity, while lamenting what she called a lopsided tax code that favors wealthy people like them. The Clintons have grown immensely better off in the 15 years since they left the White House, primarily through book deals, paid speeches and other business ventures involving Mr. Clinton. Mrs. Clinton has devoted a fair amount of time since April, when she began her second presidential campaign, to showing she understands the needs of working-class Americans, who have not seen their wages grow in years, and those struggling in the post-recession job market. That effort was made particularly urgent after Mrs. Clinton said last year that she and her husband were \u201cdead broke\u201d when they left the White House. The remark was widely seized upon by Republicans who argued she was out of touch. The Clintons have previously released their tax returns for the period from 1977, when they entered public life, through 2006. The new ones show that from 2007 through 2014 the couple paid $43,885,310 in federal taxes, for an effective tax rate of 31.55 percent. They gave nearly $15 million to charity, or an average of 10.8 percent of their earnings. Their charitable deductions ranged from $550,000 in 2008 to more than $3 million in 2007, 2013 and 2014. All but $190,450 of their personal charitable giving passed through their philanthropic entity, the Clinton Family Foundation, the returns show. The beneficiaries of that foundation, which files a separate tax return, include their larger foundation ($1.865 million in 2014), as well as the Museum for African Art in New York, the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in California and the American Ireland Fund, based in New York. Among Mrs. Clinton\u2019s disclosures Friday was that she was paid $9.68 million in 2013 for 41 speeches, all in the United States except for two in Toronto. She topped out at $400,000 for a speech to the Jewish United Fund/Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago. Her standard rate was $225,000. She gave three speeches to Goldman Sachs in 2013 and was paid a total of $675,000 for them; her husband was paid $200,000 by Goldman Sachs for a speech in New York, two days after Mrs. Clinton spoke to the bank in South Carolina, according to an accompanying list of his 2013 speaking fees. In all, Mr. Clinton earned $13.17 million in 2013, also for 41 speeches, the most lucrative of these, at $750,000, for addressing Handelsbanken Capital Markets in Stockholm that May; Mr. Clinton listed a second payment of $100,000 from the same company the same day. Fifteen of his speeches were abroad. Besides the royalties from his books and his speaking fees, Mr. Clinton earned nearly $20 million between 2011 and 2014 for advising or consulting companies. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way from my days going door to door for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund and earning $16,450 as a young law professor in Arkansas \u2014 and we owe it to the opportunities America provides,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in her statement. Her aides hope to set up a favorable contrast for her with former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, a leading Republican contender, who has argued he is more transparent than she is. A month ago, when Mr. Bush released his own tax returns, he said: \u201cOne fun fact I learned in this process: I have paid a higher tax rate than the Clintons even though I earned less income.\u201d Mr. Bush said his average federal tax rate was 36 percent, and contrasted that with what he said was the Clintons\u2019 2014 tax rate: 30 percent. It was unclear where Mr. Bush got the figure. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tax return showed that her 2014 federal tax rate was 35.72, and, with city and state income taxes, was a combined rate of 45.8 percent. Florida has no state income tax.",

        "body": " Donald J. Trump on Tuesday assailed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Supreme Court for speaking out on the presidential race, calling her disdainful remarks about his candidacy \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d and suggesting that she owed other justices an apology. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks came in a telephone interview with The Times two days after Justice Ginsburg was quoted as saying she was frightened about what the nation would look like if he were elected. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what this place would be \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine what the country would be \u2014 with Donald Trump as our president,\u201d Justice Ginsburg told The Times in an interview published Sunday. \u201cFor the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be \u2014 I don\u2019t even want to contemplate that.\u201d She even joked ruefully about moving to New Zealand. Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, said he found those remarks unbefitting a member of the high court. \u201cI think it\u2019s highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a disgrace to the court and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldn\u2019t believe it when I saw it.\u201d He continued: \u201cThat she should be saying that? It\u2019s so beneath the court for her to be making statements like that. It only energizes my base even more. And I would hope that she would get off the court as soon as possible.\u201d Mr. Trump also said he expected to announce his choice of a running mate by Friday, winding down a process that has been closely watched as in all likelihood the most significant decision he will make in his campaign. \u201cI have five candidates, plus two, two that are unknown to anybody,\u201d Mr. Trump said from Chicago, where he was raising money for his campaign. \u201cI will be making a decision over the next three- to four-day period of time, and I think it will be a decision that will be a very good decision for a lot of people,\u201d he added. Mr. Trump said that he was not basing his vice-presidential selection on fund-raising prowess or potential, and indicated that he had had enough experience with many of those he has been considering for the job that their tryouts on the campaign trail would not necessarily be determinative. \u201cI\u2019ve been with these people for a long time \u2014 I know them,\u201d Mr. Trump said, specifically invoking Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. \u201cChristie was excellent yesterday and Newt is excellent.\u201d Mr. Trump will appear on Tuesday night in Indiana with Gov. Mike Pence, who has risen in the estimation of many of the nominee\u2019s advisers. Mr. Trump said his decision was largely coming down to instinct. \u201cA lot of is gut. A lot of it is,\u201d he said. \u201cMy whole life has been about gut.\u201d He also suggested that he would consider polling in states like heavily Democratic Connecticut, which he again said he believed he could put in play in November. Asked for quick thoughts about each of the candidates he is known to be considering, Mr. Trump played along. Governor Christie? \u201cStrong,\u201d he said. Retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn? \u201cA patriot.\u201d Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa? \u201cA terrific, exciting person.\u201d Governor Pence? \u201cSolid as a rock.\u201d And Mr. Gingrich? \u201cNewt is Newt.

        "body": " Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. pleaded guilty Wednesday in federal court to charges that he spent $750,000 in campaign cash on personal items. The Illinois Democrat faces up to five years in prison, but guidelines recommend slightly less. Sentencing has been set for June 28. \u201cI truly understand the consequences of my actions and of the preceding,\u201d Jackson said through tears. \u201cI did these things. \u2026 I used money that should have been used for my campaign.\u201d Federal prosecutors say Jackson, who resigned from Congress in November amid the investigation and health issues, used campaign money to buy items including a $43,350 gold-plated men's Rolex watch and $9,587.64 worth of children's furniture. He and his wife, Sandra, had agreed to plead guilty in deals with federal prosecutors. Jackson's guilty plea was to a conspiracy charge. His wife later pleaded guilty Wednesday to a charge of filing false joint federal income tax returns for the years 2006 through 2011 that knowingly understated the income the couple received. Jackson told the judge that he had been hospitalized for psychological issues. The whole hearing lasted about 50 minutes. \"Not a proud day,\" he said. \"I'm sorry I let everybody down.\" The Jacksons were appearing separately before U.S. District Judge Robert L. Wilkins in Washington, D.C. Jackson's wife spent $5,150 on fur capes and parkas, court documents said. When prosecutors charged the couple last Friday, the ex-congressman said he fully accepts the responsibility for the improper decisions and mistakes he has made. Tom Kirsch, an attorney for Jackson's wife, said she has signed a plea agreement with federal prosecutors and would plead guilty to one tax count. The conspiracy charge against the former congressman carries a maximum statutory penalty of up to five years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, and other penalties. The charge against Sandra Jackson carries a maximum of three years in prison. However, one of her lawyers, Tom Kirsch, says the plea agreement \"does not contemplate a sentence of that length.\" Sandra Jackson was a Chicago alderman before she resigned last month during the federal investigation. In court papers filed against Jackson on Friday, prosecutors said that upon conviction he must forfeit $750,000, plus tens of thousands of dollars' worth of memorabilia items and furs. The memorabilia includes a football signed by U.S. presidents, a Michael Jackson fedora, and memorabilia of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Jimi Hendrix and Bruce Lee -- all from a company called Antiquities of Nevada. As the hearing for Jackson got under way Wednesday, newly filed court papers disclosed that the judge had offered to disqualify himself from handling the cases against Jackson and his wife. As a Harvard Law School student, Wilkins said he had supported the presidential campaign of Jackson's father, civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, and that as an attorney in 1999, Wilkins had been a guest on a show hosted by Jackson's father. In the newly filed court papers, prosecutors and lawyers for both Jesse Jackson Jr. and Sandra Jackson said they were willing to proceed with the cases with Wilkins presiding. Judicial ethics require that a judge disqualify himself if his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.",

Jan Brewer (R) announced her decision to veto legislation on Wednesday that would have allowed businesses to legally refuse service to anyone on \"religious freedom\" grounds, effectively allowing them to discriminate against same-sex couples. Brewer said the bill had \"the potential to create more problems than it purports to solve.\" \"Senate Bill 1062 does not address a specific or present concern related to religious liberty in Arizona,\" she said. \"I have not heard one example where business owners' religious liberty has been violated.\" The state legislature passed the bill, known as SB 1062, last week. But in recent days, it has come under intense criticism from activists, lawmakers and business interests both in Arizona and nationally. The state's two Republican senators, Jeff Flake and John McCain, called on Brewer to veto it, and major corporations like Marriott, Apple and American Airlines all wrote to the governor and expressed their opposition. Businesses in the Phoenix area were also especially worried, with the Super Bowl set to be held in Glendale, Ariz. in 2015. On Monday, the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee came out against SB 1062, stating, \"[W]e have heard loud and clear from our various stakeholders that adoption of this legislation would not only run contrary to that goal but deal a significant blow to the state's economic growth potential.

        "body": " Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee announced Tuesday he is running for president, delivering an economy- and security-centered message that he hopes will appeal to everyday Americans and distinguish him from the already-crowded Republican field. Huckabee, who is embarking on his second presidential run, made the announcement in his hometown of Hope, Ark. In a 30-minute speech that focused on his humble beginnings, Huckabee vowed to end \u201cstagnant wages,\u201d protect Medicare and defeat radical Islamic terrorism. \u201cFolks cannot seem to get ahead or even stay even,\u201d he said. Huckabee, a former Baptist minister, ran for president in 2008, winning eight states including the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses before running out of money and exiting the race. \u201cFolks, it\u2019s a long way from a little brick rented house on Second Street in Hope, Arkansas, to the White House,\u201d he said. \"But here in this small town called Hope, I was raised to believe where a person started didn't mean that is where he had to stop. I always believed that kid could go from hope to higher ground.\" The 59-year-old Huckabee has a strong following among the party\u2019s evangelical Christian base but this time will face stiff competition for that vote from such primary candidates as Dr. Ben Carson and Sen. Ted Cruz, of Texas. He frequently repeated the phrase, \u201cHope to higher ground,\u201d which appears to be a slogan of sorts for his 2016 campaign. He also took a swipe at President Obama for declining to recognize the Islamic State group as radical Islamic terrorists and vowed to stop them. \"I wonder if he can watch a Western from the '50s and be able to figure out who the good guy and the bad guys really are,\" Huckabee said. \"As president, I promise you, we will no longer try to contain Jihadism. We will conquer it.\u201d He also vowed to protect Medicare and give states more of a say in government and education. Huckabee, who left his job as a Fox News host earlier this year in preparation for a potential 2016 run, was Arkansas governor from 1996 to 2007, serving after Bill Clinton, who also is from Hope. And he was the state\u2019s lieutenant governor from 1993 to 1996. Even before the speech, Huckabee was trying to position himself as the GOP candidate best equipped to defeat Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner. In a recent campaign video, Huckabee argued that in his more than 10 years as governor, he took on Democrats in \"Bill Clinton's Arkansas\" after then-candidate Bill Clinton won election to the White House in 1992. \"Every day in my life in politics was a fight,\" Huckabee says in the video, released as a preview of his Tuesday announcement. \"But any drunken redneck can walk into a bar and start a fight. A leader only starts a fight he's prepared to finish.\" The field of confirmed and potential GOP presidential candidates includes more than a dozen people. A new NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll of GOP primary voters shows 23 percent picked former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as their first choice. Bush is followed in the poll by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio with 18 percent, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker with 14 percent, Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul with 11 percent, Carson with 7 percent, Huckabee and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 5 percent, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry at 2 percent and former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina at 1 percent. Huckabee is the third Republican this week to announce a 2016 White House bid, following Fiorina and Carson, a retired neurosurgeon They join Cruz, Paul and Rubio. Campaign aides say Huckabee\u2019s path to winning the party nomination this time will be to appeal to working-class cultural conservatives, pitching their candidate as an economic populist and foreign affairs hawk who holds deeply conservative views on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage. Huckabee advocates a national consumption tax, which is similar to a sales tax, to replace the existing federal taxes on personal income and payrolls. He rejects calls for a minimum wage hike, saying his proposals will yield a \"maximum wage\" for workers. On immigration, he insists on a secure border and bemoans the presence of millions of people who are living in the country illegally, though he favors a creating a path to citizenship for children of immigrant parents who brought them to the U.S. illegally. Like other Republican White House hopefuls, Huckabee is sharply critical of Obama's foreign policy. He has called for \"bombing the daylights\" out of Islamic State targets in the Middle East, though he says American troops should be deployed to the region only as part of an international coalition that includes nations such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan. But whatever the issue, Huckabee, also an author, wraps his appeal as a pitch to everyday Americans who he says \"don't feel like anybody understands or knows who they are, much less cares what's happening to them.\" Evangelical Christian voters helped Huckabee win the Iowa caucuses in 2008 and finish a strong second in South Carolina, the largest of the early-voting states. He would need to replicate that early success to create an opening to build a wider coalition and compete deep into the primary schedule.",

        "body": " President Trump, 24 hours from his self-imposed deadline for picking a new F.B.I. director, told reporters on Thursday that he was \u201cvery close\u201d to choosing a successor to James B. Comey, and he named Joseph I. Lieberman, the former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, as a finalist. But members of Mr. Trump\u2019s staff \u2014 alarmed by his rapid embrace of Mr. Lieberman, a charming 75-year-old political operator with no federal law enforcement experience \u2014 have quietly urged him to take more time to make such a critical hire. By late Thursday, the president appeared increasingly likely to leave Friday for a nine-day foreign trip without picking a new director, according to three senior administration officials speaking on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Lieberman, who served three terms in the Senate as a Democrat and one as an independent, would be an atypical choice to lead the F.B.I., whose agents prize the bureau\u2019s independence as one of Washington\u2019s few apolitical institutions. Judges and former prosecutors, not elected officials, have frequently been chosen. Administration officials described the search as fluid and said the president and his team were keeping the decision-making process closely held to avoid the leaks that Mr. Trump believes are endemic to the West Wing. Still, Mr. Trump, speaking briefly with reporters in the Oval Office as he met with President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, offered an emphatic \u201cyes\u201d when asked whether Mr. Lieberman was among the finalists. \u201cWe need a great director of the F.B.I. I cherish the F.B.I. It\u2019s special,\u201d he told reporters later at a joint East Room news conference with Mr. Santos. \u201cAll over the world, no matter where you go, the F.B.I. is special. The F.B.I. has not had that special reputation with what happened in the campaign, what happened with respect to the Clinton campaign, and even, you could say \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 with respect to the much more successful Trump campaign.\u201d It was unclear whether the president\u2019s acknowledgment that Mr. Lieberman was a finalist was intended to stoke the \u201cApprentice\u201d-style frenzy of speculation he has favored with other high-profile picks, only to opt for a lesser-known candidate. Mr. Trump is still seeking applicants, and some aides, along with many law enforcement officials, have suggested that he hire from within the agency to repair some of the damage to morale wrought by Mr. Comey\u2019s sudden firing. Adam S. Lee, the well-regarded special agent in charge of the bureau\u2019s Richmond, Va., field office, was interviewed, as were Richard A. McFeely, a former senior official at the F.B.I., and Andrew G. McCabe, the acting director. Mr. McCabe, a veteran agent who joined the bureau in 1996 and once specialized in Russian organized crime, was named deputy director in 2016. It is not clear whether he will return to that role once Mr. Comey\u2019s replacement is confirmed. All three men are under consideration, the administration officials said, even if Mr. Lieberman, who was Al Gore\u2019s running mate in the 2000 presidential campaign, is the front-runner. Mr. Trump and Mr. Lieberman had good chemistry when they met privately, one White House aide said \u2014 a key ingredient for Mr. Trump in hiring people. He is also friendly with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator, who has told Trump aides that Mr. Lieberman would most likely receive overwhelming support in the Senate. Democrats pushed back hard on that notion, casting the conservative Mr. Lieberman as a Democrat in name only and noting that he publicly supported Mr. Trump\u2019s pick of Michael T. Flynn as his first national security adviser. At a closed-door Democratic lunch on Thursday, Senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois urged party members to hold the line if he is selected. But casting Mr. Lieberman as the most likely choice did have one immediate advantage: It appealed to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who had suggested this week that the firestorm over Mr. Trump\u2019s ouster of Mr. Comey was as bad as Watergate. Mr. McCain defended Mr. Lieberman, who endorsed his 2008 run for president. The White House remains divided, and several senior officials expressed serious doubts about Mr. Lieberman. His age, 75, could be problematic, they said, given that F.B.I. directors serve 10-year terms. And he is employed by one of the firms where Marc E. Kasowitz, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, works, raising the prospect of conflict-of-interest accusations. If Mr. Trump picks Mr. Lieberman, one adviser said he might serve for a short stint \u2014 to lend his bipartisan reputation to a president badly in needed of credibility \u2014 instead of the full term. Mr. Lieberman also has law enforcement experience as the former attorney general of Connecticut. Others on Mr. Trump\u2019s list are former Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma and former Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, both Republicans. Mr. Rogers, a former F.B.I. agent, was endorsed by the agents\u2019 association. Also interviewed were two other judges, Michael J. Garcia of the New York State Court of Appeals and Henry E. Hudson of Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The House passed the Democrats\u2019 showcase anti-corruption and voting rights legislation on Friday, an expansive measure that aims to dismantle barriers to the ballot box, end big money in politics and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials. The sweeping legislation, passed 234-193, makes good on the campaign pledge to clean up Washington that helped catapult Democrats into the majority. It also serves as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of 2020. It has virtually no chance of passing the Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s a power grab for the American people,\u201d said Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, who leads the House administration committee that shepherded the legislation. The ambitious compendium, at nearly 700 pages, includes proposals designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, and restoring voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. It also creates a six-to-one matching system for donations of up to $200 to congressional and presidential candidates who reject high-dollar contributions, funded by an additional fine on corporations found to have broken the law. Republicans arguably have spent more time trying to define the bill \u2014 called the For the People Act or H.R. 1, to underscore its primacy \u2014 and tear it down than Democrats have spent trying to promote it. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has branded it the \u201cDemocrat Politician Protection Act\u201d in weekly speeches, and pledged not to take up the legislation. The House Republican leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, also criticized the legislation. \u201cThis bill is a massive federal government takeover that would undermine the integrity of our elections,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said in a speech on Friday, in an attack on \u201cthis new, Democrat, socialist majority.\u201d Some of the most debated provisions are intended to reveal who funds online political ads and finances so-called dark-money groups. The Disclose Act, part of the bill, would require super PACs and nonprofit organizations that spend money in elections to disclose the names of donors who contribute more than $10,000. Democrats say such disclosure is broadly popular with voters across the political spectrum. \u201cCongress cannot meaningfully address the nation\u2019s significant challenges without first recognizing and acknowledging the undue influence of special interests in our politics,\u201d said Representative Abigail Spanberger, Democrat of Virginia. Some of those provisions, however, have drawn criticism from both conservative and liberal groups that argue the language is overly broad and would infringe on First Amendment rights. The American Civil Liberties Union urged members to vote against the bill. Democrats have also used the legislation to make clear that they believe that cleanup must start with the White House, and included several provisions jabbing at the president and homing in on a laundry list of his administration\u2019s alleged ethical abuses. It would require presidents and vice presidents, as well as candidates for the nation\u2019s highest offices, to release at least 10 years of federal tax returns \u2014 Mr. Trump has released none \u2014 and it stipulates that inaugural committees must disclose their expenditures. And an amendment sponsored by Representative Raul Ruiz of California would prohibit federal funds from being spent at businesses owned or controlled by the president, the vice president or any cabinet official. Federal agencies spent about $13 million on four of Mr. Trump\u2019s trips to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in early 2017, according to a report by a nonpartisan congressional watchdog agency issued last month. Two other measures also zero in on the costs of administration officials\u2019 travel.

        "body": " Obama urges new restrictions on assault weapons, magazines as part of gun control plan President Obama called Wednesday for a new and tougher assault-weapons ban and a 10-round limit on magazines, as part of a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence that includes 23 steps he took without congressional action. Already facing stiff opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, the president called on Congress to pass several major changes to the country's current gun laws -- some of which are already being considered like the restrictions on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines. Obama called as well for legislation to bar the possession and importation of armor-piercing bullets and to require criminal background checks for nearly all gun sales. The president, speaking at the White House, said he would use \"whatever weight this office holds\" to get the proposals passed. \"If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try,\" Obama said. \"When it comes to protecting the most vulnerable among us, we must act now. ... Let's do the right thing.\" The president was joined by four children who wrote to the White House about gun violence following the Connecticut mass shooting in which 20 children were killed. Though the administration faced some criticism for involving children in the program, they were positioned off to the side while Obama spoke. Despite discussions earlier about addressing the pervasive violence in the entertainment and video game industries, the president's plan did not address those issues in depth. The plan, though, does call for a range of measures to improve access to mental health services and improve safety at America's schools. The president, immediately after making his remarks, signed nearly two-dozen executive actions -- a step that has stirred objections from lawmakers who have warned Obama not to overstep his bounds. Unilaterally, Obama on Wednesday directed federal agencies to share information with the federal background check system; proposed new rules to let law enforcement run full background checks before returning a seized gun; ordered the Centers for Disease Control to research causes of gun violence; required law enforcement to trace guns from criminal investigations; and took other steps. Plus Obama is nominating ATF Acting Director Todd Jones to officially lead the agency The most controversial elements of the president's plan, though, continue to be the proposals he wants Congress to pass. The call for universal background checks would extend to gun shows and private sales, with \"limited\" exemptions for \"certain transfers\" among family members and other situations. The administration plans to give private sellers guidance on how to run background checks as soon as possible. Plus the president wants to commit $4 billion to hiring more police officers, and to pass new gun trafficking laws to explicitly prohibit straw purchasing. The plan was already earning a mixed response from lawmakers. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., accused Obama of trying to \"undermine Americans' constitutional right to bear arms\" without doing enough to focus on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. \"Nothing the president is proposing would have stopped the massacre at Sandy Hook. President Obama is targeting the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens instead of seriously addressing the real underlying causes of such violence,\" he said. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said \"all options should be on the table.\" Texas Gov. Rick Perry, in a written statement, said: \"Guns require a finger to pull the trigger. The sad young man who did that in Newtown was clearly haunted by demons and no gun law could have saved the children in Sandy Hook Elementary from his terror.\" Gun-rights groups say the effort to impose more gun control measures is misguided, noting in particular that most killings in America are committed with handguns and not the assault weapons the administration intends to target. Some local officials have vowed to resist federal action. The National Rifle Association also plans to launch a major ad campaign. The group's first ad called Obama an \"elitist hypocrite\" for his daughters' security detail. Obama has been critical of the NRA's plan to install armed security in every school. The White House plan does address school security, urging Congress to help schools complete emergency plans; proposing an initiative to help schools hire up to 1,000 resource officers and mental health professionals; and proposing new training for teachers to recognize mental health issues among young people. Obama also plans to beef up mental health coverage via executive action. House Speaker John Boehner declined to weigh in on the merits of the president's proposals Wednesday. \"House committees of jurisdiction will review these recommendations. And if the Senate passes a bill, we will also take a look at that,\" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said.",

Todd Akin (R-Mo.) to drop out of the U.S. Senate race in Missouri. \"As I said yesterday, Todd Akin's comments were offensive and wrong and he should very seriously consider what course would be in the best interest of our country,\" said Romney in a statement. \"Today, his fellow Missourians urged him to step aside, and I think he should accept their counsel and exit the Senate race.\" Akin, however, continued his refusal to step down Tuesday in a subsequent interview on Sean Hannity's radio show. \"It still seems to me that there has to be room \u2026 to broaden the scope of what a campaign needs to be about,\" he said, going on to suggest Romney had made a bigger deal of the remark than he needed to. \"Why can't Mitt Romney run his race and I'll run mine?\" Akin continued. He later confirmed that vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan called him and told him to \"give some thought to stepping down,\" but didn't tell him to get out. Akin also claimed he would help Romney and the Republican party in November by soldiering on, but admitted that no senator had called him to ask him to stay in the race. On Sunday, Akin prompted outrage with his response to a question about supporting abortion in the case of rape. \"From what I understand from doctors, that's really rare,\" said Akin said of pregnancies caused by rape. \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume maybe that didn't work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist.\" Romney had stopped short of calling on Akin to resign in an interview with WMUR Monday. Other officials in the GOP, including five senior Missouri Republicans, were less forgiving, however, suggesting that Akin had created an irreversible distraction and could no longer run as a viable candidate. Akin had also vowed to remain in the race earlier Tuesday on the radio show of former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. During the interview, Akin said he would continue campaigning because he still believed he could win.",

John McCain (R-Ariz.) suggested Thursday that Hillary Clinton\u2019s exclusive use of personal email while serving as secretary of state was hypocritical.  \u201cThis is the same individual that just excoriated the Bush administration for supposedly hiding communications within the administration,\u201d McCain said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAndrea Mitchell Reports.\u201d While serving as a senator from New York in 2007, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its \"secrecy,\" according to The Hill. \"We know about the secret wiretaps, we know about the secret military tribunals, the secret White House email accounts,\" she said. \"It\u2019s a stunning record of secrecy and corruption, of cronyism run amok.\" Clinton, who is often described as the Democratic presidential frontrunner for 2016, has faced scrutiny since Monday when The New York Times reported that she may have violated federal records law by using a personal email account for all of her work messages as secretary of state. She served in that position from 2009 to 2013. Democrats came to her defense, and other media outlets soon pointed out that the rules against using personal email were not relayed to government officials until 2014. But likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush suggested that the use of personal email demonstrated a lack of transparency. Clinton responded to the controversy on Wednesday, tweeting that she had asked the State Department to make her private emails publicly available. While on Mitchell's show, McCain also raised the concern that there's no way of knowing if all of Clinton's emails have been saved, since they were not originally retained by the government. \"The question that I think's gonna rise over time is, how can we be confident that once she carries out what she tweeted -- that she wants all the emails known -- how are we gonna know that? How are we gonna have verification of that?\" McCain said. \"So I think this is serious. And I'm willing to give her or anyone who defends her the benefit of defending it or explaining it, but on its face, it seems to be rather serious.\"",

        "body": " LIVINGSTON, N.J. \u2014 Gov. Chris Christie declared an uphill candidacy for president on Tuesday with New Jersey-style swagger, unconcealed disgust for Washington and a high regard for his own candor, vowing that \u201cthere is one thing you will know for sure: I say what I mean and I mean what I say.\u201d Relying on his biggest, and perhaps his last, remaining advantage in a field of better-financed and better-liked rivals \u2014 his personality \u2014 Mr. Christie portrayed himself as the only candidate in the Republican field who is forthright and forceful enough to run the country. \u201cWe need strength and decision-making and authority back in the Oval Office,\u201d he said. Pacing the stage without a prepared text and raising his voice to a shout at times, he vowed to campaign and govern as a colorful teller of difficult truths, even if \u201cit makes you cringe every once in a while.\u201d \u201cI am not running for president of the United States as surrogate for being elected prom king of America,\u201d Mr. Christie said inside the gymnasium at the high school where he was president of his class all three years. \u201cI am not going to be the most popular guy who looks into your eye every day and says what you want to hear,\u201d he continued. Trying to claw his way back to the top of the Republican field, Mr. Christie took a pointed swipe at his rivals who are in the United States Senate, like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who have never run a state government. \u201cUnlike some people who offer themselves for president in 2016, you won\u2019t have to wonder whether I can do it or not,\u201d he said, invoking the \u201ceconomic calamity\u201d he said he inherited in 2010 and the \u201cunprecedented natural disaster,\u201d Hurricane Sandy, that he weathered as governor. But he reserved his deepest disdain for Congress and for the president\u2019s stewardship of foreign affairs, and extended that critique to President Obama\u2019s former secretary of state. \u201cAfter seven years of a weak and feckless foreign policy run by Barack Obama, we better not turn it over to his second mate, Hillary Clinton,\u201d Mr. Christie said. Still, he blamed both parties for dysfunction and gridlock in Washington. \u201cIf Washington and Adams and Jefferson believed that compromise was a dirty word, we\u2019d still be under the crown of England,\u201d he said. Mr. Christie, whose dazzling rise as a national Republican in his first term was matched only by his spectacular loss of stature at home in his second, entered the presidential race bearing little resemblance to the candidate he once expected to be. The economic recovery he promised has turned into a cascade of ugly credit downgrades and anemic job growth. The state pension system he vowed to fix has descended into a morass of missed payments and lawsuits. The administration he pledged would be a paragon of ethics has instead conspired to mire an entire town in traffic and the governor\u2019s office in scandal. Three and a half years ago, Mr. Christie seemed such an antidote to all that ailed the Republican brand that senior figures in the party pleaded with him to run for president as a substitute for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney. But now, a staggering 55 percent of Republican primary voters say that they cannot envision voting for Mr. Christie, according to an NBC-Wall Street Journal Poll. The only candidate less palatable: Donald J. Trump, the bombastic developer turned reality television star. With two pillars of his presidential run \u2014 his record and his judgment \u2014 looking wobbly, Mr. Christie must now build a campaign around his most raw and prodigious asset: his personality, a magnetic mix of quick-witted charm, insult-trading banter, vulnerability, empathy and effrontery. It was on vivid display Tuesday before hundreds of supporters, including many of Mr. Christie\u2019s oldest friends and most loyal aides. He joked about the need for a new and refined tax code that would finally put his father, a certified public account standing nearby, out of business. He described the decision to enter politics as a \u201ccoin toss\u201d between him and his wife, Mary Pat, herself a nimble political mind. And he put an unusual twist on the dilemma facing the financially stretched Social Security system. \u201cThe lying and stealing has already happened, the horse is out of the barn, we need to get it back in, and the only way to do it is by force,\u201d he said. Mr. Christie, 52, honed his political technique, and developed a YouTube following, during a remarkable run of 137 town-hall-style meetings across New Jersey. Not surprisingly, he plans to put the town hall meeting at the center of his candidacy \u2014 and to put his hopes in a state, New Hampshire, that is famed for its own town hall meetings. He is forgoing the customary tour of early-voting states that usually follows a formal announcement, aides said. Instead, Mr. Christie will plant himself in New Hampshire for a week, holding one town hall after another. Such single-mindedness belies the serious and stubborn vulnerabilities of his campaign. As a centrist candidate from the Northeast, he would have a difficult path to the Republican presidential nomination under the best circumstances. And circumstances are anything but optimal for him: He faces a wide field of candidates, including several who are better financed and beloved by mainstream donors (Jeb Bush), hold greater appeal to conservative voters who dominate the primary process (Scott Walker), are agile public speakers with persuasive biographies (Mr. Rubio), or are better liked by Republican voters (all of the above). At his announcement, Mr. Christie sought political rebirth, as he has before, by relying on his powers as a narrator, and mythologizer, of his own story. Running for president is a new and bigger stage, though, and both Mr. Christie\u2019s stagecraft and his oratory showed room for improvement. The first speaker who preceded him to the stage had no microphone, causing a delay; later on, she was booed when she disclosed that she was a Democrat. Without a text, Mr. Christie frequently descended into clich\u00e9s. \u201cThe truth will set us free,\u201d he said at one point. \u201cOne person can make a difference,\u201d he said at another. But he also spoke with emotional power, as when he recalled his father\u2019s early job in an ice cream factory in Newark. \u201cThink about how amazing this country is,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cThat one generation removed from that guy who was working on the floor of the Breyers ice cream plant, his son is the two-term governor of the state that he was born and raised in.\u201d The question for Mr. Christie, after a bruising year of watching his story rewritten by others, may be whether Republican voters, who can choose from among a long and intriguing list of fresher faces, will give him a fighting chance to sell himself anew.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration tried Saturday to marshal new evidence in defense of its collection of private Internet and telephone data, arguing that a secret program called Prism is simply an \u201cinternal government computer system\u201d designed to sort through court-supervised collection of data, and that Congress has been briefed 13 times on the programs since 2009. After rushing to declassify some carefully selected descriptions of the programs, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, conceded for the first time that the Prism program existed. But in a statement, after denouncing the leak of the data to The Guardian and The Washington Post, Mr. Clapper insisted it was \u201cnot an undisclosed collection or data mining program.\u201d Instead, he said it was a computer system to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the collection of foreign intelligence that had been authorized by Congress. Mr. Clapper also insisted that the government \u201cdoes not unilaterally obtain information from the servers\u201d of telephone and Internet providers, saying that information is turned over only under court order, when there is a \u201cdocumented, foreign intelligence purpose for acquisition\u201d of the data. He appeared to be attempting to push back against early reports that the government had direct access to the huge computer servers at Google, Microsoft, Facebook and similar companies. Those firms have denied they give the government a \u201cback door\u201d to their systems. But they acknowledge handing over material when ordered to do so by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, though they have not described the mechanism for complying with those orders. It appears the companies use some kind of electronic drop box, in which they place the material, so that the government can then harvest the information. The national intelligence director\u2019s rare Saturday statement was notable for what it omitted: any description of other means the government may use to intercept Internet information directly from fiber optic cables or satellite systems even before or after it reaches those Internet companies. A new report in The Guardian, published online on Saturday, cited another document that showed that in March 2013 there were 97 billion pieces of data collected from networks worldwide; about 14 percent of it was from Iran, much was from Pakistan and about 3 percent came from inside the United States, though some of that may have been foreign data traffic routed through American-based servers. Meanwhile, senior Obama administration officials, including the directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and of national intelligence, have held 13 classified hearings and briefings for members of Congress since 2009 to explain the broad authority they say they have to sweep up electronic records for national security purposes, a senior administration official said Saturday. The administration, by disclosing the briefings, sought to push back on claims by Democrats and Republicans in Congress that they were either not aware of programs to mine vast amounts of Internet data and business telephone records or were insufficiently briefed on the details. Lawmakers said that what they knew was vague and broad \u2014 and that strict rules of classification prevented them from truly debating the programs or conducting proper oversight. In separate but identical letters sent on Oct. 19, 2011, Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich told two of Congress\u2019s most outspoken critics of the efforts, Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado, both Democrats, that in December 2009 and February 2011 the Justice Department and intelligence agencies provided a classified document to Congress describing the surveillance efforts in detail. The letter said the House and Senate Intelligence Committees had been briefed \u201con these operations multiple times and have had access to copies of the classified\u201d orders and opinions of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Members of the committee were invited to share the information with other lawmakers. Broader briefings were held in 2011 before the reauthorization of the Patriot Act, the post-Sept. 11 law that authorized much of the surveillance. \u201cAgainst this backdrop, we do not believe the executive branch is operating pursuant to \u2018secret law\u2019 or \u2018secret opinions of the Department of Justice,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Weich wrote. \u201cRather, the intelligence community is conducting court-authorized intelligence activities pursuant to a public statute, with the knowledge and oversight of Congress and the Intelligence Committees of both houses.\u201d On Friday, Mr. Udall and Mr. Wyden released a joint statement repeating that they had \u201clong been concerned about the degree to which this collection has relied on \u2018secret law.\u2019 \u201d \u201cSenior administration officials have stated on multiple occasions that the Patriot Act\u2019s \u2018business records\u2019 authority is \u2018analogous to a grand jury subpoena,\u2019 \u201d they said. They added that \u201cmultiple senior officials have stated that U.S. intelligence agencies do not collect information or dossiers on \u2018millions of Americans,\u2019 \u201d assertions that they believe have been contradicted by revelations of Internet data mining and a court order asking a Verizon subsidiary to turn over logs of telephone calls. \u201cNow that the fact of bulk collection has been declassified, we believe that more information about the scale of the collection, and specifically whether it involves the records of \u2018millions of Americans,\u2019 should be declassified as well,\u201d they said. The list of briefings begins on May 12, 2009, with a classified hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee involving Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the head of the United States Cyber Command, and David S. Kris, assistant attorney general for national security. On Feb. 14, 2011, all senators were offered the opportunity to discuss the broad authority under the Patriot Act with the director of national intelligence, Mr. Clapper; the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III; and General Alexander. Mr. Mueller spoke to the House Republican Conference on May 13, 2011, and to the House Democratic Caucus on May 24, 2011. On Feb. 8, 2011, Senators Dianne Feinstein of California, the chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, and Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the panel, invited every senator to a briefing with Mr. Clapper and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to discuss expiring provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The provisions \u2014 \u201cone on roving authority for electronic surveillance and the other on the acquisition of business records that are relevant to investigations to protect against international terrorism or espionage\u201d \u2014 were added to the 1978 law by the Patriot Act. But Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Democrat, draws a distinction between the holding of such briefings and the informed consent of Congress. Very few lawmakers avail themselves of such briefings, he suggested, and only the most senior leaders are kept fully abreast of intelligence activities. \u201cYou can count on two hands the number of people in Congress who really know,\u201d he said in an interview on Friday.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON -- In the wake of Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee, the politics of Medicare have become almost as complicated as the policy itself. The most recent back-and-forth between the Romney and Obama campaigns concerns which candidate would do more harm to people's benefits. While the president's team has pointed to the Republican plan to turn Medicare into a quasi-voucher program -- in which recipients would receive a check to buy either insurance through the private market or traditional Medicare -- the Romney team has responded by noting that Obama took more than $700 billion out of Medicare as part of his health care overhaul. \"He stole $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare,\" said RNC Chair Reince Priebus. \"If any person in this entire debate has blood on their hands in regard to Medicare, it's Barack Obama.\" That rejoinder is now a subject of intense debate. The money being taken out of the system by the Affordable Care Act is mostly derived from limiting the expected rate of growth in the program. The savings come predominantly from limiting waste, fraud and abuse, mostly in Medicare Advantage, and are budgeted to help subsidize insurance for people under the ACA. As such, independent fact-checkers and news analysts alike have disputed the Romney campaign's characterization. Part of the reason that the Obama campaign is crying foul over this line of criticism, however, may be because it knows how effective it can be. Republicans also used the charge that Obamacare raided Medicare as a primary attack line in the 2010 congressional elections. Two years prior, then-Senator Obama used virtually identical language to beat up on his general election opponent, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.): \"How would your golden years turn out under John McCain? His health care plan would cut Medicare by $800 billion -- that means a 22 percent cut in benefits. Higher premiums and co-pays ... after a lifetime of work, senior's health care shouldn't be a gamble. John McCain's plan, it's not the change we need.\" Obama made the same argument on the stump. \"It turns out, Senator McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare: $882 billion worth -- $882 billion in Medicare cuts to pay for a ill-conceived, badly thought-through health care plan that won't provide more health care to people, even though Medicare is already facing a looming shortfall,\" Obama declared at a campaign stop in Roanoke, Va. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, McCain's policy director at the time, recalled that the attack originated with a Wall Street Journal article that referenced his saying that McCain would assume savings in Medicare and Medicaid spending to make his health care plan budget neutral. Those savings were expected to come from eliminating fraud and reforming payment policies. The possibility of increasing Medicare premiums for higher-income earners was also floated. FactCheck.org rated the Obama ad as \"false,\" noting that the McCain campaign wasn't talking about slashing benefits but limiting waste and slowing the rate of growth. Holtz-Eakin said, \"We were looking for efficiencies in delivery a la Managed Medicaid.\" This was a relatively minor aspect of the Obama campaign's assault on McCain's Medicare record. The more substantive criticism concerned McCain's proposal to tax worker health care plans as a way of generating money to give people a new tax credit so that they could buy private insurance. \"Like Governor Romney has refused to specify how he will pay for his $5 trillion tax cuts weighted toward millionaires, Senator McCain would have cut $1.3 trillion from health care programs to pay for tax cuts while refusing to rule out cutting benefits or to say what he was cutting,\" Obama's current campaign press secretary, Ben LaBolt, said in an email to The Huffington Post. \"President Obama achieved a third as much savings by eliminating unnecessary subsidies to insurances companies and getting waste and fraud out of the system in order to improve seniors' benefits -- saving them $600 a year on prescription drugs and providing them with access to preventive care. Senator McCain and Governor Romney have subsequently opposed the savings that the president identified and demagogued the issue, ironically, since Governor Romney's running mate kept them in his budget.\" But the attack on McCain's accounting was part of the assault nonetheless. And in light of the current debate over Medicare proposals, it could complicate the political dialogue even further. Certainly, as the Washington Examiner's Phillip Klein notes, it will contribute to the general reluctance to talk substantively about Medicare reform out of a concern that it merely invites future attacks.",

The indictments did reveal that attempts to hack into Democratic Party emails occurred later the same day that Trump called on Russians in a speech to uncover emails that his rival Hillary Clinton had held on a private server. \u201cI will tell you this, Russia: If you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Trump said at a Florida news conference on July 27, 2016. \u201cI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\u201d White House officials were reportedly furious that the indictments were announced by U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Friday morning, just days before the planned summit with Putin. \u201cIt\u2019s a big F-U from [special prosecutor Robert] Mueller,\u201d a White House official told Politico, adding that it \u201cwasn\u2019t an accident\u201d that the indictments were announced before the Helsinki summit.",

Asa Hutchinson (R) signed a revised version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act on Thursday, one day after refusing to sign an earlier version of the bill over concerns about discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. Earlier Thursday, the Republican-controlled state legislature passed a new version of the bill at the governor's request, amending provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. The amended legislation mirrors the federal RFRA. Meanwhile, legislators in Indiana have made changes to the controversial RFRA signed into law by Gov. Mike Pence (R) last week. On Thursday, the state's general assembly passed new language explicitly stating that the law does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The changes came amid immense national backlash, with dozens of politicians, business leaders and celebrities speaking out against the bill. In a Wednesday press conference announcing his opposition to the initial version of the bill, Hutchinson said his son had asked him to veto the legislation. \"My son Seth signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill,\" he said. \"And he gave me permission to make that reference, and it shows that families -- and there's a generational difference of opinion on these issues.\" Hutchinson also faced pressure from Walmart, which is headquartered in the state. CEO Doug McMillon called on the governor to veto the bill, which he said \"threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion.\"",

        "body": " President Donald Trump announced Friday a short-term plan that will reopen the government for three weeks so that border security negotiations may continue without the devastating effects of the partial government shutdown. Trump said he\u2019s prepared to sign a bill to open the government through Feb. 15. Federal employees will get back pay \u201cvery quickly or as soon as possible,\u201d he said. Shortly after the announcement, the Senate and House both passed a resolution to reopen the government through that date. The announcement comes on the 35th day of the longest shutdown in United States history and is a clear cave by Trump, whose impasse over the budget stems from his demands for $5.7 billion in funds for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2015 a project Democratic lawmakers say is a firm deal-breaker. If funding for his border wall is not secured by the end of the negotiation period, Trump said he is prepared to shut down the government again or issue a national emergency declaration in order to get funding \u2015 a plan that would strip funding from disaster recovery efforts. Throughout the shutdown, Trump\u2019s reputation has suffered across parties as airports have grappled with severe delays and federal workers have gone without paychecks, putting many at risk of losing their homes, defaulting on loans and missing other crucial payments. Trump\u2019s statement comes a day after the Senate failed to pass his proposal to reopen the government with border wall funding in exchange for temporary legal protection for some undocumented immigrants. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was in the middle of a roundtable with Capitol Hill reporters when reports began surfacing of Trump\u2019s support for a short-term government funding bill. She was mum on whether she considered his proposal a final deal. \u201cWe\u2019re going in that direction but we\u2019re not to that place,\u201d said Pelosi. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) spoke on the Senate floor shortly after Trump\u2019s announcement, congratulating lawmakers on the development. \u201cThe solution to this impasse was to separate funding the government from our disagreements over border security,\u201d Schumer said, adding that \u201cwe can never hold American workers hostage again.\u201d Trump spent most of his speech on Friday rehashing his usual talking points about crime at the border. \u201cWe really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or a steel barrier,\u201d he said.",

        "body": " Even for a Congress known to battle over every little detail, reading the U.S. Constitution aloud sounded like a simple exercise. Turned out it wasn't. Newly sworn members of the House reading aloud the country's founding document on Thursday didn't recite every verse and article of the document because Republicans decided that the obsolete parts can be skipped since they've been superseded by amendment. For instance, lawmakers did not read the 18th Amendment, which imposed prohibition on liquor in 1919. However, they did read the 21st Amendment, which repealed prohibition in 1933 and is still in force. Republicans also left out the part about counting slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person. Portions of the U.S. Constitution are never deleted, just amended, as has been done 27 times in history. But all the original decisions remain in the Constitution, including in the copies authorized by Congress' Joint Committee on Printing and used in Thursday's reading. And that was the point of contention for Democratic lawmakers who complained that exempting parts of the document from the reading undermines the objective of the exercise. \"This is very emotional for me,\" Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., said on the floor before the reading began. \"Given the struggle of African Americans, given the struggle of women, given the struggle of others to create a more perfect document, to hear that those elements of the Constitution that have been dedacted (sic) by amendment are no less serious, no less part of our ongoing struggle to improve the country and our desire to continue to improve the Constitution, many of us don't want that to be lost upon the reading of our sacred document,\" he said. Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., commented that the original document has been changed through amendment, leaving the the reader to interpret the operative language. \"I think it would be helpful to the members if you would explain to us how the determinations of what to read has been made or not made so that we all be on the same page as to congressional intent,\" he said to Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., who presided over the reading. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., questioned the reading of the \"amended\" Constitution. \"To not read the full document, including all the text that was later amended, is to fail to acknowledge the struggle our nation has constantly fought, within and without, to 'keep' our Republic,\" he said in a written statement. \"It is a failure to show Americans that while we seek a more perfect union, we do so from imperfect beginnings, through an imperfect history, with an imperfect government created by an imperfect document,\" he added. \"We fail to show the American people that imperfection is not to be feared and that our ability to constantly improve on what the Founders gave us is a blessing, not a reason for divisiveness.\" Other lawmakers decried the exercise altogether, saying the Constitution is a living document that shouldn't be followed to the letter. \"They are reading it like a sacred text,\" Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the former chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, told The Washington Post. Nadler derided what he called the \"ritualistic reading\" as \"total nonsense\" and \"propaganda\" intended to give Republicans claim to the document. He argued that the Founders were not \"demigods\" and that the document's needs for amendments to abolish slavery and other injustices showed it was \"highly imperfect.\" \"You are not supposed to worship your Constitution,\" he told the newspaper. \"You are supposed to govern your government by it.\" But for all those who described the exercise as political waste -- including Vanity Fair magazine, which estimated it as costing more than $1 million -- supporters noted that it was an historic moment -- the first time the U.S. Constitution had been read on the U.S. House floor. \"I think that this is a very symbolic showing to the American people and reminder to the members of congress that we are a government of laws not of men and that this Constitution is the foundation for all of our laws,\" Goodlatte said. And backers said that it wouldn't hurt to try to live by the aspirations of the Founding Fathers. \"I don't think the Constitution is propaganda. I think it's a valuable exercise and an important moment in this Congress for us to read the Constitution,\" said Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y. \"But I do think that you can't just read it like a speech and then leave skid marks on it in your legislative record.\" Historian Alan Brinkley of Columbia University told Fox News the reading may be \"a bit of theater,\" but it is \"not insignificant given that many Republicans have decided -- implausibly, in my opinion -- that the Constitution is the vehicle that can reduce the size of government.\" But Roger Pilon of the Cato Institute said Congress needs to re-read the Constitution to be reminded how out of control government has become. \"Today the Congress regulates our lives and redistributes our wealth in ways that would shock the Founders,\" he said. \"The Constitution, they wrote that to ensure limited government and they meant for most of us to live our lives free from government, in the private sector, planning and living our own lives, not as dependents on government goods and services.\" Pilon added that the Founders never intended for the Constitution to be viewed as fluid advice. \"When liberals tell today that the Constitution is essentially a blank slate to be filled by transient majorities, nothing could be further from the truth. If that were so, it would never have been ratified in the first place,\" he said. As the Constitution was being read inside the lower chamber, Nadler and others gathered outside the Capitol to push for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, a perennial effort to update the document with a statement on women. \"John Boehner and his cronies are holding up the U.S. Constitution as a sacred, perfect document. But we know the Constitution is far from perfect because it does not guarantee women's equality,\" NOW President Terry O'Neill said in a statement.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2013- The White House on Wednesday released the full set of emails surrounding the Obama administration\u2019s development of talking points describing the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, in response to continuing charges from congressional Republicans that there was a massive political \u201ccover-up\u201d of what transpired there. Nothing in the emails supports theories that the talking points were changed in order to influence the 2012 election. In a briefing with reporters at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, senior administration officials used the 100 pages of emails to show that a number of government agencies, not just the State Department, drove many of the changes to the talking points that were ultimately used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice. The cache of emails paint a fuller picture than did an email leaked earlier this week, which portrayed a State Department concerned about its public image. Republican lawmakers have argued that the State Department and the White House were attempting to alter the talking points for political reasons and ignored suggestions and language put forward by the CIA. In particular, they pointed to the fact that references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings were removed. But senior administration officials stressed on Wednesday that such language in fact was taken out at the request of the CIA. Critics have said the role of State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in revising the talking points in particular shows an administration trying to protect its reputation as being tough on terrorism. They have criticized Nuland for requesting to remove a line from the final draft noting that there had been \"at least five other attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi by unidentified assailants.\" Nuland said in a Sept. 14 email that she didn't want that information included because it \"could be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings, so why would we want to feed that either? Concerned ...\" But senior administration officials on Wednesday said that Michael J. Morell, then the deputy director of the CIA, also wanted that line removed, separately from Nuland. Morell believed it was irrelevant to the message of the talking points -- what happened in Benghazi -- and unprofessional to include those warnings but not allow State Department officials to include how they had responded to them. Separate from Wednesday's document release, the CIA recently conducted an internal review of how and why the talking points were changed -- a move that also came in response to the continuing questions from Congress. That review showed that many changes were made to the original talking points -- drafted by a senior officer -- over concerns about accuracy, an FBI investigation and other bureaucratic matters. A U.S. intelligence official told The Huffington Post the review was completed \"early this year.\" Senior administration officials, discussing that internal review, relayed that some CIA officials didn't like that the original draft of the talking points said the government \"know[s] that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack,\" because at that time it was premature to name those responsible for the attacks. Their concerns at other times were more mundane. For example, CIA officials also decided to change the phrase \"attacks in Benghazi ... evolved into a direct assault against the US Consulate\" to \"demonstrations in Benghazi\" because they believed \"attacks\" and \"assault\" were synonymous, making the phrase illogical. CIA officers also removed the reference to al Qaeda in order to avoid prejudging the outcome of a FBI investigation into the incident. A reference to another terrorist group, Ansar al-Sharia, was left in, but later removed at the request of the State Department; the CIA agreed with that decision, again so as not to hinder the FBI investigation. The timing of the White House's document release raises its own set of questions. Why, for example, did the administration choose to make the emails public now, after months of enduring criticism and requests for more information? If the material was too sensitive to share publicly months, weeks or days ago, what changed on Wednesday? While the document dump does soften some of the more critical theories that have arisen with respect to the White House's handling of the events in Benghazi, it could also embolden critics who now see an administration willing to accommodate demands for documents. In a response shortly after the emails were made public on Wednesday, Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), said just that. \"The House interim report found that 'senior State Department officials requested the talking points be changed to avoid criticism for ignoring the threat environment in Benghazi' and that those changes were ultimately made,\" said Buck. \"Those findings are confirmed by the emails released today, and they contradict statements made by the White House that it and the State Department only changed one word in the talking points. The seemingly political nature of the State Department\u2019s concerns raises questions about the motivations behind these changes and who at the State Department was seeking them.\" UPDATE: 9 p.m. -- White House spokesman Eric Schultz said he hoped Wednesday's disclosure would put to rest the Benghazi issue. \u201cDespite the fact that e-mails relating to the Benghazi talking points were made available to members of Congress several months ago, in recent days these e-mails have been selectively and inaccurately read out to the media. To make clear what is and is not in these e-mails, today the White House took the extraordinary step of releasing these e-mails,\" Schultz said. \"You can now see what the Congress has seen -- collectively these emails make clear that the interagency process, including the White House's interactions, were focused on providing the facts as we knew them based on the best information available at the time and protecting an ongoing investigation. After 11 hearings, 25,000 pages of documents, and now this release, we can hopefully spend our time working on what\u2019s important \u2013 what we can do together to ensure those serving their nation overseas are better protected than they were last September.\u201d",

        "body": " President Obama was heading to Detroit Monday afternoon to continue campaigning for tax hikes on top earners -- a day after a face-to-face meeting with House Speaker John Boehner that offered slight hope the two could be making progress toward a deal. The president and the speaker met Sunday afternoon at the White House for the first time in weeks. It came after Boehner publicly chided Obama on Friday for the lack of progress to date, accusing the president of having \"wasted another week.\" Both sides were tightlipped about the surprise Sunday afternoon meeting. But instead of emerging from the talks complaining about each other, as was the case following phone calls last week, each side released an identical statement. \"This afternoon, the President and Speaker Boehner met at the White House to discuss efforts to resolve the fiscal cliff. We're not reading out details of the conversation, but the lines of communication remain open,\" the statement released by each office said. Lawmakers and the White House have three weeks to reach a deal, before a potentially crippling set of tax hikes and spending cuts takes effect. Boehner last week put a counter-proposal on the table that included $800 billion in revenue increases over the next decade. While Boehner cast that as a significant concession, Obama said it didn't go far enough because it didn't include an increase in tax rates for the top 2 percent. Boehner, though, is facing some pressure from Republicans to give a little bit more. The speaker is effectively caught between two competing wings of the Republican Party. Some say Congress should not raise any taxes, and were disappointed he went so far as to put any revenue on the table. However, a growing number of Republicans are suggesting the party should give Obama what he wants on tax rates -- and focus instead on winning entitlement cuts once that is cleared away. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., became the latest Republican to open the door to tax rate hikes during an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"There is a growing group of folks that are looking at this and realizing that we don't have a lot of cards as it relates to the tax issue, before year-end. I mean, we have one house, that's it,\" Corker said. Corker suggested that Republicans instead focus on extracting entitlement cuts as part of the debt-ceiling negotiations. \"Republicans know that they have the debt ceiling that's coming up right around the corner, and the leverage is going to shift, as soon as we get beyond this issue,\" Corker said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"The leverage is going to shift to our side, where hopefully we'll do the same thing we did last time.\" Corker said that if the president wants to raise the debt limit by $2 trillion, Republicans should press for $2 trillion in spending cuts. That prospect is sure to infuriate the White House. After the bruising debt-ceiling fight from 2011, Obama recently warned that he will not \"play that game\" again. \"We've got to break that habit before it starts,\" the president said. The president argues that fights over the debt ceiling merely shake global confidence in the country's ability to pay its bills, and as part of talks over the looming fiscal crisis has called for a de facto permanent increase in the debt limit. It's unclear whether Obama might drop that demand if he gets what he wants on tax rates. His campaign-style visit to Detroit, though, threatens to muddy the waters on talks. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the No. 3 Republican in the House, suggested Sunday that the president's itinerary has left Republicans to negotiate with themselves. \"He's been to Pennsylvania. Tomorrow he is going to Detroit. It's now time to govern. The election is over,\" he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" Democratic Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin countered that Obama \"is a phone call away and you know it.\"",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Anthony D. Weiner, trying to put to rest a bizarre episode that is overshadowing his role as liberal pugilist and threatening his dream of becoming New York\u2019s mayor, emphatically denied on Wednesday that he had sent a suggestive photograph to a woman in Washington State but said he could not be sure that he is not the person in the image. \u201cThis was essentially a hacked account that had a gag photo sent out on it,\u201d Mr. Weiner, a Democrat, said during an interview in his office here. \u201cI can\u2019t say with certainty very much about where the photograph came from.\u201d On Tuesday, Mr. Weiner presided over two testy news briefings at which he had dodged a variety of questions. On Wednesday, he adopted a strikingly different approach, sitting patiently for a series of interviews at which he insisted he had done nothing wrong and marveled at what he said on MSNBC was the \u201cAlice in Wonderland world\u201d in which a wayward Twitter message had become the talk of the town. Mr. Weiner, one of Congress\u2019s most enthusiastic users of social media to engage with constituents and supporters, said he believed his Twitter account, or a related photo-sharing site, had been infiltrated by a hacker or a prankster, who had then sent the offending photo out late Friday. He said that he had hired an Internet security company and a lawyer to look into the matter, but that he did not believe the episode merited investigation by federal law enforcement. He did not rule out the possibility that the photo was of him, but said he did not know who could have sent it. He said he did not know the woman who received the photo, Gennette Cordova, a student at Whatcom Community College in Bellingham, Wash.; she followed him on Twitter. He said he regretted that Ms. Cordova was caught in the middle of the controversy. She issued a statement over the weekend saying she had never met him, and she has not spoken out since. \u201cI just feel terrible for her,\u201d Mr. Weiner said, adding that he had never corresponded with her. \u201cShe has committed no crime except to follow me on Twitter.\u201d The congressman also expressed concern about the toll the episode was taking on his wife, Huma Abedin, a longtime aide to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m protecting my wife, who every day is waking up to these insane stories that are getting so far from reality,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve been married less than a year.\u201d Asked on CNN whether he still wished to be mayor, he said, \u201cPut it this way: It\u2019s the only better job than the one I have.\u201d Jack Levin, the chief executive of yFrog, the Twitter-affiliated image and video service that was used to upload the photo, said in an interview on Wednesday that his company did not have reason to believe that its user passwords were exposed or stolen. He said it was possible that the photo could have been sent from Mr. Weiner\u2019s yFrog account through his Twitter password or through a yFrog password. Mr. Levin said neither Mr. Weiner\u2019s office nor any law enforcement authorities had contacted him or his company to inquire about the photo. Twitter, which does not comment on individual user accounts for privacy reasons, has declined to say whether Mr. Weiner\u2019s account was hacked. Despite the swirl of events that has buffeted him for several days, Mr. Weiner has not abandoned his sharp humor. Suggesting that the photo might have been altered, he alluded to a \u201cDaily Show\u201d sketch on Tuesday in which the comedian Jon Stewart, a longtime friend, had joked that the photo could not have been of the congressman. \u201cI don\u2019t have memory of this photograph,\u201d Mr. Weiner said in the interview in his office. \u201cBut I also ... you know, Jon Stewart might have had it right last night: that there were elements of this photograph that might have been doctored.\u201d He paused, then added: \u201cBut I don\u2019t know that. And I don\u2019t want that to be the headline.\u201d",

        "body": " Federal authorities made an arrest on Friday in connection with the nationwide bombing campaign against outspoken critics of President Trump, a significant breakthrough in a case that has gripped the country in the days leading up to the midterm elections. A law enforcement official identified the suspect as Cesar Sayoc Jr., 56, of Aventura, Fla., just north of Miami. Mr. Sayoc, a registered Republican, has a lengthy criminal history in Florida dating back to 1991 that includes felony theft, drug and fraud charges, as well as being arrested and accused of threatening to use a bomb, public records show. His criminal record from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement indicates that at the time of his last arrest in 2015, he was 5-foot-11 and 215 pounds.  He has brown eyes, black hair and a scar on his left arm, the records said, and was born in New York.  The records listed Mr. Sayoc\u2019s occupation as \u201cmanager.\u201d According to a 2012 bankruptcy petition filed in Miami, Mr. Sayoc resided at the time at his mother\u2019s home.  \u201cLives w/mom,\u201d a handwritten note on the petition said.  \u201cHas no furniture.\u201d On Friday morning, the authorities surrounded a white van with pro-Trump stickers on it, and television news later showed images of the authorities hauling the van away on a truck underneath a tarp.  But it remained unclear if the van belonged to Mr. Sayoc. Some residents of Aventura reported seeing a similar white van covered in pro-Trump stickers often parked in the lot of a local strip mall, the Aventura Waterways shopping center.  But it was not immediately clear if that van was the same one seized by the police on Friday. \u201cIt struck me because of the crazy conspiratorial stickers covering the windows,\u201d said David Cypkin, a documentary film producer and editor with the Rakontur production company.  \u201cIt was unsettling, and also it seemed to be occupied.  Sometimes the door would be ajar or a window would be open, which indicated to me that maybe somebody was living in the van.\u201d Speaking at the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump praised law enforcement officials for quickly arresting a suspect. \u201cThese terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cWe must never allow political violence to take root in America.\u201d Mr. Sayoc\u2019s arrest came only hours after the mysterious spate of pipe bombs spread further as federal authorities said on Friday morning that they had found two more of the explosive devices: one addressed to Senator Cory Booker and the other to James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence. Although no formal charges have been filed yet in the case, two of the law enforcement officials said there was a high likelihood that Mr. Sayoc would be prosecuted at least in part in Federal District Court in Manhattan.  The F.B.I.\u2019s New York office has been leading the investigation and five of the bombs sent this week fall under the jurisdiction of the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan. The package addressed to Mr. Clapper was meant to be delivered to the New York offices of CNN, where he works as an analyst, but was intercepted at a mail facility in Midtown Manhattan, police officials in New York City said.  The package addressed to Mr. Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, was found in Florida, which two people briefed on the matter have said has become a focus of the intense, nationwide investigation into the bombs. At a news conference on Friday morning, John Miller, the New York Police Department\u2019s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, said a postal worker at the mail facility on 52nd Street recognized the package addressed to Mr. Clapper as similar to other suspicious packages discovered this week and \u201cfroze it in the system.\u201d The department\u2019s bomb squad responded to the facility and secured the package for delivery to an F.B.I. lab in Quantico, Va., Mr. Miller said. Speaking on CNN on Friday, Mr. Clapper said he was not surprised that a device had been sent to him.  He has been a frequent critic of President Trump, a similarity shared with everyone whose names have appeared on the packages discovered so far. \u201cThis is definitely domestic terrorism,\u201d Mr. Clapper said.  \u201cAnyone who has in any way been a critic, publicly been a critic of President Trump, needs to be on an extra alert.\u201d Mr. Clapper also said that on Wednesday night he had taken precautions after the first packages were discovered.  While he and his wife were away from their home this week, he added, he told his neighbor not to collect their mail. All together, 12 crude explosive devices have been found since Monday, sent through the mail to a host of Democrats and other prominent figures who have been among Mr. Trump\u2019s most vocal detractors.  The packages \u2014 virtually identical in plain manila envelopes \u2014 have been addressed to former President Barack Obama; former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; Representative Maxine Waters of California; former Attorney General Eric Holder; John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director, the actor Robert De Niro; and George Soros, the billionaire Democratic donor. All of the envelopes had return address labels bearing the misspelled name of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat whose district is in southern Florida.  None of the devices inside have exploded on their own so far, and investigators are still seeking to determine whether they were even capable of detonating.  But the authorities in New York and elsewhere have warned that the devices should be considered dangerous. The first package was discovered on Monday afternoon at the suburban New York home of Mr. Soros.  While investigators initially thought that some devices were hand delivered, they now believe it is likely all of them were sent in the mail.  Using information collected by the United States Postal Service, investigators have focused their attention on certain Florida postal centers, including one in Opa-locka near Miami.",

        "body": " The White House asked former President Bill Clinton to talk to Rep. Joe Sestak about the possibility of obtaining a senior position in the Obama administration if he would drop out of the Democratic primary race against establishment-backed Sen. Arlen Specter, the Obama administration said in a report released Friday morning. But the report, by White House Counsel Robert Bauer, concluded that \"allegations of improper conduct rest on factual errors and lack a basis in the law.\" Batting down allegations that the White House dangled the secretary of Navy position in front of Sestak, the report said that Sestak was offered executive branch positions on advisory boards that were uncompensated. One of the jobs Clinton specifically discussed with Sestak was the president's intelligence advisory board. But a White House official said the plan always was for Sestak to remain in the House, and he couldn't have served in the House and on the president's intelligence advisory board. The report also described the Clinton conversations as informal and not tied to any precise job offer since, as a former president, Clinton could not guarantee Sestak anything. Clinton initiated conversations with Sestak at the behest of White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, who was Clinton's political director when he was president. As president, Clinton promoted Sestak to vice admiral and made him his director of defense policy. Sestak was also a loyal and tireless supporter of Hillary Clinton's run for the presidency in 2008. At hastily arranged news conference Friday afternoon, Sestak said Clinton called him last summer to express concerns over his jumping into the Senate primary, and how his military background could help him leave a mark on the House. Sestak said he almost interrupted Clinton to tell him Clinton that \"I am going to decide to get into this or not only depending upon what's good for Pennsylvania's working families and not an offer. And he said 'I knew you'd say that,'\" before the conversation moved on to other subjects. The White House report disputed any suggestion that there was \"impropriety\" in Clinton's discussion with Sestak over possible alternatives to his Senate candidacy. \"There have been numerous, reported instances in the past when prior administrations -- both Democratic and Republican, and motivated by the same goals -- discussed alternative paths to service for qualified individuals also considering campaigns for public office,\" the report read. \"Such discussions are fully consistent with the relevant law and ethical requirements.\" The report comes one day after President Obama insisted \"nothing improper\" happened with Sestak. On that same day, Obama had lunch with Clinton. \"This is punishable by prison. This is a felony,\" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., who has been leading the charge for more details on the allegation. \"This is about the White House. This is not about Congressman Sestak,\" Issa said, adding that he wants to know what Clinton was empowered to say. \"They've answered a question and it begs many more answers,\" he said. \"We want elections not to be appointments.\" Sestak's opponent in the general election for the Senate seat, Republican Pat Toomey, questioned why it took so long for this explanation. \"If this explanation is as innocent as it looks, I sure don't know why it took three months to say so,\" Toomey said in a statement. \"As I've said many times, this job offer issue is not my focus, and it's not where Pennsylvanians want the focus of the campaign to be.\" Critics say the Sestak job offer may have violated the part of the U.S. code that says: \"Whoever, directly or indirectly, promises any employment, position, compensation...appointment...provided for or made possible in whole or in part by any Act of Congress...to any person as consideration, favor, or reward for any political activity...or in connection with any primary election ...shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\"",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 All same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, even if the state where they live does not recognize their union, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service said Thursday. It is the broadest federal rule change to come out of the landmark Supreme Court decision in June that struck down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, and a sign of how quickly the government is moving to treat gay couples in the same way that it does straight couples. The June decision found that same-sex couples were entitled to federal benefits, but left open the question of how Washington would actually administer them. The Treasury Department answered some of those questions on Thursday. As of the 2013 tax year, same-sex spouses who are legally married will not be able to file federal tax returns as if either were single. Instead, they must file together as \u201cmarried filing jointly\u201d or individually as \u201cmarried filing separately.\u201d Their address or the location of their wedding does not matter, as long as the marriage is legal: a same-sex couple who marry in Albany, N.Y., and move to Alabama are treated the same as a same-sex couple who marry and live in Massachusetts. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax-filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said. \u201cThis ruling also assures legally married same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country knowing that their federal filing status will not change.\u201d Gay and civil rights groups praised the ruling. \u201cCommitted and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nation\u2019s federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home,\u201d said Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign. \u201cThese families finally have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act.\u201d But the Treasury decision could have ramifications for many gay couples\u2019 tax liabilities, said Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. Couples with similar incomes often pay the \u201cmarriage penalty,\u201d with their tax liability as a couple being much higher than it would be if they were single. At the same time, same-sex couples will also be able to file amended returns for certain prior tax years, meaning that many couples might be eligible for refunds. Couples do not have to file amended returns if they do not want to, a senior Treasury official said, meaning that couples who might pay the marriage penalty would not owe back taxes. But the ruling creates complications for same-sex couples who live in any of the 37 states that do not recognize their marriages. Previously, such couples filed federal and state tax returns as individuals. Now, they will have to file their federal returns as other married couples do, but may be required to file their state returns as individuals. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a cumbersome workaround,\u201d said Nanette Lee Miller of Marcum L.L.P., a public accounting firm. She sees it as a paperwork bother more than a financial issue. States might also respond to the federal ruling with changes of their own. \u201cMost state income tax regimes begin with federal taxable income as the starting point,\u201d Marvin Kirsner, a tax lawyer at Greenberg Traurig, said in an e-mail. \u201cThese state taxing authorities will have to figure out how to deal with a same-sex married couple who file a joint income tax return for federal tax purposes.\u201d He added, \u201cWe will need to see guidance from each nonrecognition state to see how this will be handled.\u201d The rule change is likely to provide a small increase for federal revenue, as more same-sex couples pay the marriage penalty, Mr. Williams said, describing it as a \u201crounding error.\u201d But it would be partly offset by new federal spending on benefits for same-sex spouses. The ruling applies to all legal marriages made in the United States or foreign countries. But it does not extend to civil unions, registered domestic partnerships or other legal relationships, the Treasury said. The Treasury ruling is one of many that are starting to emerge from all corners of the federal government as Washington changes regulations to conform with the Supreme Court decision. Separately, the Health and Human Services Department said Thursday that Medicare would extend certain key benefits to same-sex spouses, \u201cclarifying that all beneficiaries in private Medicare plans have access to equal coverage when it comes to care in a nursing home where their spouse lives.\u201d But federal agencies are not moving in lock step. Instead, they are creating a patchwork of regulations affecting gay and lesbian couples \u2014 and may be raising questions about discrimination and fairness in the way that federal benefits are distributed. Medicare and Treasury officials have said they would use a \u201cplace of celebration\u201d standard for determining whether gay couples are eligible for benefits. That means same-sex couples would receive benefits as long as they are legally married, regardless of where they live. But the Social Security Administration is now using a \u201cplace of residence\u201d standard in determining spousal benefits, and a gay couple in Alabama might not receive the same benefits as a gay couple in New York until final determinations are made or Congress acts. The Obama administration has pushed federal agencies to ensure the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling is carried out quickly and smoothly. \u201cIt would be nice if they were consistent,\u201d Ms. Miller said. Creating federal regulations is a process and could change, she said.",

        "body": " Updated: Rick Santorum on Sunday tried to clarify his comment that President Obama subscribed to a \u201cphony theology,\u201d saying he was referring not to the president\u2019s faith but to his view of man\u2019s relationship to the world. It was during a campaign stop in Ohio on Saturday that Mr. Santorum described what he called the \u201cphony theology\u201d of Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda. \u201cIt\u2019s about some phony ideal, some phony theology. Oh, not a theology based on the Bible, a different theology,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no less a theology.\u201d On Sunday, Robert Gibbs, a political adviser to President Obama, criticized such attacks on \u201ccharacter and faith.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t help but think that those remarks are well over the line. It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s destructive,\u201d Mr. Gibbs said on the ABC News program \u201cThis Week,\u201d adding that it reflected the \u201cnastiness, divisiveness, ugliness\u201d and distortions of a hard-fought Republican nominating process. Mr. Santorum, at another appearance on Saturday, in Columbus, Ohio, called the idea of schools being run by the federal government or by state governments \u201canachronistic.\u201d Mr. Santorum did not say public schools were a bad idea, and he said that there was a role for government help in education. \u201cWhere did they come up that public education and bigger education bureaucracies was the rule in America?\u201d he said. \u201cParents educated their children, because it\u2019s their responsibility to educate their children.\u201d \u201cYes the government can help,\u201d Mr. Santorum added. \u201cBut the idea that the federal government should be running schools, frankly \u2014 much less that the state government should be running schools \u2014 is anachronistic. It goes back to the time of industrialization of America when people came off the farms where they did home-school or have the little neighborhood school, and into these big factories, so we built equal factories called public schools. And while those factories as we all know in Ohio and Pennsylvania have fundamentally changed, the factory school has not.\u201d Asked about those remarks on the CBS News program \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Mr. Santorum, who with his wife has home-schooled their children, remained adamant on Sunday. While he said he did not oppose government financing of schools, Mr. Santorum said that \u201cpublic education should be a dynamic process that\u2019s locally run.\u201d \u201cI think the parent should be in charge,\u201d he added, \u201cworking with the local school district to try to design an educational environment for each child that optimizes their potential.\u201d Mr. Santorum also defended his criticism of a requirement in the president\u2019s health-care policy that insurance companies to cover prenatal testing. He had said earlier that the policy was included to save money \u201cbecause free prenatal testing ends up in more abortions and therefore less care that has to be done, because we cull the ranks of the disabled in our society.\u201d The former Pennsylvania senator has a 3-year-old daughter, Bella, with a serious chromosomal disorder, and he said that doctors who detect such a condition before birth typically recommend abortion. Asked whether he was suggesting that Mr. Obama lacked sympathy for the disabled, Mr. Santorum did not back down, saying, \u201cI think the president has a very bad record on the issue of abortion and children who are disabled.\u201d One of Mr. Santorum\u2019s rivals for the Republican nomination, Representative Ron Paul of Texas, scoffed at Mr. Santorum on Sunday for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception \u2013 and for believing that he could defeat Mr. Obama. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s possible,\u201d Mr. Paul said on the CNN program \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cAnd this whole idea about talking about the social issues and who is going to pay for birth control pills,\u201d Mr. Paul said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about undermining our civil liberties, the constant wars going on, the debt of $16 trillion.

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Donald John Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, ushering in a new era that he vowed would shatter the established order and reverse a national decline that he called \u201cthis American carnage.\u201d In a ceremony that capped a remarkable rise to power, Mr. Trump presented himself as the leader of a populist uprising to restore lost greatness. He outlined a dark vision of an America afflicted by \u201cthe ravages\u201d of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, requiring his can-do approach to turn around. \u201cI will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down,\u201d Mr. Trump told hundreds of thousands of rain-soaked admirers and onlookers in a forceful 16-minute Inaugural Address from the West Front of the Capitol. \u201cAmerica will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s ascension amounted to a hostile takeover of a capital facing its most significant disruption in generations. While officially a Republican, he has taken on leaders of both parties and, with no prior political career of his own, made clear that he saw himself as the ultimate outsider not beholden to the current system. \u201cWe will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s view of the United States was strikingly grim for an Inaugural Address \u2014 a country where mothers and children are \u201ctrapped in poverty in our inner cities,\u201d where \u201crusted-out factories\u201d are \u201cscattered like tombstones across the landscape\u201d and where drugs and crime \u201chave stolen too many lives.\u201d \u201cThis American carnage,\u201d he declared, \u201cstops right here and stops right now.\u201d He got started right away with rolling back the policies of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, by issuing orders freezing new regulations from recent weeks and ordering agencies to \u201cease the burden\u201d of the Affordable Care Act during the transition from repealing to replacing the law. More orders are planned for next week. Wearing a dark suit and red tie and accompanied by his wife, Melania, in a powder-blue suit and matching gloves, Mr. Trump took the 35-word oath administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. precisely at noon. Michael Richard Pence, a former governor and congressman from Indiana, was sworn in minutes before as vice president by Justice Clarence Thomas. Mr. Trump assumed the presidency of a country still unsettled after a polarizing election and entered office with less support in polls than any other president in recent history. It was clear from the day that there would be no grace period either for or by the new president. The Senate confirmed two cabinet nominations \u2014 James N. Mattis as defense secretary and John F. Kelly as secretary of homeland security \u2014 but Democrats temporarily held up Mike Pompeo\u2019s confirmation as C.I.A. director. Throughout the day, there were mostly peaceful protests against the new president. Sporadic violence broke out as demonstrators smashed shop windows and burned a limousine, while police officers in riot helmets responded with tear gas. More than 200 people were arrested. Liberal groups prepared for a women\u2019s march on Saturday that they said could draw hundreds of thousands. Mr. Trump made only passing efforts to reach out to Democrats beyond thanking Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, for their handling of the transition. \u201cThey have been magnificent,\u201d he said in his speech. He later praised his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, at a lobster-and-beef luncheon with congressional leaders, asking her and former President Bill Clinton to stand for applause. \u201cI have a lot of respect for these two people,\u201d he said. Democrats were not impressed. \u201cI was pretty shocked by how dark it was,\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said of Mr. Trump\u2019s Inaugural Address. \u201cI love this country, and I don\u2019t understand how a president of the United States that loves his country could paint a picture of its failures.\u201d He added, \u201cIt was interesting sitting up onstage with a bunch of billionaires hearing him say how bad the country was.\u201d The National Mall was filled with supporters, many wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats and chanting \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d But the lingering animosity from the presidential campaign was on display, too. When Mrs. Clinton arrived, some in the crowd chanted, \u201cLock her up,\u201d mimicking Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign rallies. As he took the oath, a cluster of people blew whistles and screamed, \u201cNot my president,\u201d before being escorted out. While large, the crowds on a soggy day did not rival the energetic throngs at Mr. Obama\u2019s first inauguration eight years ago, according to aerial photographs. The Washington Metrorail system recorded fewer than half as many rides on Friday morning as in 2009, and knots of bystanders along the inaugural parade route were not as thick. In a city that gave just 4 percent of its vote to Mr. Trump, many residents left town and about 60 House Democrats boycotted the event. Mr. Obama made his exit after the ceremony, flying by helicopter to Joint Base Andrews in the Maryland suburbs, where he thanked former aides and members of his administration before boarding the presidential jet, no longer designated Air Force One, to fly to Palm Springs, Calif., for vacation. He will return to Washington to a rental house while his daughter Sasha finishes high school, the first president to stay in the capital since Woodrow Wilson. Hours before his departure, Mr. Obama posted on Twitter to thank followers and hint that he would not fade away. \u201cI won\u2019t stop,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by your voices of truth and justice, good humor, and love.\u201d Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill, rode an Amtrak train to Delaware and the home they have there. But they, too, planned to return, at least part time, to Washington, where Mrs. Biden teaches at a community college in the Virginia suburbs. The United States has never seen a president quite like Mr. Trump, the son and grandson of immigrants who grew up to become a real estate magnate, casino owner, beauty pageant operator and reality television star whose tumultuous love life played out in the tabloids. Never has the oath been administered to a president who had never served either in public office or as a general in the military. At age 70, Mr. Trump became the oldest president sworn in for the first time and the first born in New York since Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was also one of the wealthiest presidents ever to enter the White House, with far-reaching business connections that have already raised questions about where his interests end and the country\u2019s begin. He arrived in the Oval Office dogged by reports about Russian interference in the election on his behalf. But Mr. Trump overcame skeptics when he embarked on what seemed like a quixotic bid for the presidency. An Ivy League-educated mogul who lives in a New York tower named after himself with an 80-foot-long living room, he transformed himself into the unlikely leader of a working-class movement anchored in rural areas far removed from the coasts. His bracing candor, disregard for convention and willingness to offend whole sections of the population to make a point came across as refreshing truth-telling to many Americans disenchanted with Washington elites. For the nation\u2019s 58th inauguration, though, the untraditional president opted to follow tradition. He and Mrs. Trump, a former model from Slovenia who became the first foreign-born first lady since John Quincy Adams\u2019s wife, Louisa, started the day with a service at St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church adjacent to Lafayette Square, then joined the Obamas, Bidens and Pences for coffee at the White House. From there, the two presidents shared a limousine to the Capitol, where three other presidents waited: Mr. Clinton, Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, all of whom opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Former President George Bush remained hospitalized in Houston, recovering from pneumonia, but a spokesman said he watched the ceremony on television. Mr. Pence, 57, was sworn in at 11:54 a.m., placing his hand on Ronald Reagan\u2019s Bible, which was held by his wife, Karen, as their three adult children, Michael, Charlotte and Audrey, watched. For his oath, Mr. Trump placed his hand on two Bibles held by his wife, one given him by his mother in 1955 just before his ninth birthday and another used by Abraham Lincoln in 1861 and again by Mr. Obama in 2009 and 2013. Standing nearby were his adult children from two previous marriages, Donald Jr., Eric, Ivanka and Tiffany. Also there was Barron, his 10-year-old son with the first lady. Joining them was Ivanka\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, who will serve as an unpaid senior adviser. As Mr. Trump approached the podium, rain began to fall. It was not a conventionally Republican speech, with nothing about tax cuts or restraining government. Instead, he laid out a protectionist agenda, saying his rule will be \u201cbuy American and hire American.\u201d He did pledge to \u201ceradicate from the face of the Earth\u201d Islamic terrorism. Responding to charges that he demonized Mexicans and Muslims, Mr. Trump said, \u201cThere is no room for prejudice.\u201d Mr. Trump said the inauguration was not merely the transfer of power from one president to another. \u201cWe are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people,\u201d he said. \u201cFor too long,\u201d he continued, \u201ca small group in our nation\u2019s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished but the people did not share in the wealth.\u201d  He added, \u201cThat all changes starting right here and right now.\u201d",

        "body": " A two-term Republican congressman from Idaho with a track record of challenging the House Republican leadership said Friday he would run for the No. 2 job in the chamber. Raul Labrador, a 46-year-old Mormon father of five, tea party congressman and Puerto Rican-born only child of a single mother, will challenge House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) for the position of House majority leader. It's a long shot bid. McCarthy, 49, began gathering commitments from other House Republicans on Wednesday, the day after then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) suffered a stunning loss in the primary for his seat. In his current role as whip, McCarthy's job is to round up votes from other Republicans. The election is Thursday -- leaving little time for Labrador to build momentum and peel off votes from McCarthy. The former immigration attorney stepped forward to run after a number of other conservative House Republicans declined to. \u201cI was stunned when Eric Cantor lost his primary election earlier this week. Eric is a good friend and I have tremendous respect for him. But the message from Tuesday is clear -- Americans are looking for a change in the status quo,\" Labrador said in a statement. He also said that he would run for majority leader in hopes of creating \"a leadership team that can bring the Republican conference together.\" It's a reference to the fact that Labrador is generally respected by both the House leadership and back-bench tea party legislators. Since the 2010 midterm tea party wave election, the House GOP has contained a bloc of members who have opposed the establishment leadership time and time again. The tea party group has pulled other legislators to the right on a host of issues, including many related to government spending and debt. When Cantor lost his seat in a shock result Tuesday, conservatives in the House were not prepared to unite behind a standard-bearer, much less wage an organized effort to whip up votes in support of a candidate for majority leader. Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) was considered a front-runner to challenge McCarthy. But Hensarling pondered his options for a full day Wednesday, while McCarthy moved quickly to generate support. On Friday, the Washington Post reported that Hensarling does not plan to run, according to three people familiar with his plans. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) was the other conservative alternate to McCarthy, though he is almost as much an establishment character as anyone else in leadership. He too declined to run, sensing McCarthy's near inevitability. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) also demurred. The situation left House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and the rest of the Republican leadership in the House with a problem: The 40 or so hardline tea party members of the House GOP do not want the response to Cantor's loss -- which was driven by grassroots discontent with the establishment -- to simply be more establishment leadership. This discontent may be satisfied if Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) wins his race against Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) for House majority whip, taking McCarthy's spot. Members of the tea party caucus also want to vote for a majority leader candidate that they believe in, even if he loses. House GOP leadership understands that desire, as does Labrador. A Labrador bid helps all parties regardless of the outcome -- including Labrador himself, since a run will elevate him as a leader inside the House GOP. There is always a chance that grassroots fervor in support of Labrador could gain a level of intensity that Boehner and McCarthy did not anticipate. However, there's not a lot of time for that to happen before next Thursday's election, and leadership elections generally are dominated by inside baseball politics and arcane political interests. In addition, a few of the most hardline House Republicans, such as Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) and Rep. Michelle Bachmann (R-Minn.) said Thursday that Labrador was not conservative enough on immigration reform. Labrador is an ambitious, sometimes savvy politician. He is in Idaho this weekend chairing the state GOP convention. He also appeared Friday at an event with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who offered his support for Labrador's candidacy. \u201cThere really is a question what is the message that\u2019s sent when the voters replace someone in leadership. They want someone different. I think Raul brings that,\" Paul told reporters, according to the Spokesman-Review.",

In recent months, Obama has privately suggested that Sanders drop out of the race to help Democrats unite around Clinton and prepare for the general election.

The questions come as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee begins its confirmation hearing for Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who was tapped to replace Clinton at the department. One issue that may come up is the department's funding. Assertions that State Department posts are left vulnerable because Congress has decided not to fully fund security requests pervaded Wednesday's hearings. \"Shame on the House for ... failing to adequately fund the administration's request,\" Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said Clinton, in turn, affirmed their claims, saying budget issues are a \"bipartisan problem.\" Budget numbers, though, actually show the overall diplomatic security budget has ballooned over the past decade. Democrats point to modest decreases in funding in recent years, and the fact that Congress has approved less than was requested. But Congress often scales back the administration's requests, and not just for the State Department. And the complaints tend to overlook the fact that the overall security budget has more than doubled since fiscal 2004. For that year, the budget was $640 million. It steadily climbed to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2010. It dipped to $1.5 billion the following year and roughly $1.35 billion in fiscal 2012 -- still far more than it was a decade ago. Slightly more has been requested for fiscal 2013. It's difficult to tell how much was specifically allocated for Benghazi. Tripoli was the only post mentioned in the department's fiscal 2013 request -- funding for that location did slip, from $11.5 million in fiscal 2011 to $10.1 million the following year. Slightly more has been requested for fiscal 2013. Still, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Charlene Lamb testified in October that the size of the attack -- and not the money -- was the issue. Asked if there was any budget consideration that led her not to increase the security force, she said: \"No.\" She added: \"This was an unprecedented attack in size.\" Asked again about budget issues, Lamb said: \"Sir, if it's a volatile situation, we will move assets to cover that.\" Asked Wednesday about Lamb's testimony, Clinton noted that the review board that examined the Libya attack found budget issues have played a role. \"That's why you have an independent group like an (Accountability Review Board); that's why it was created to look at everything,\" Clinton said. But Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said \"any suggestion that this is a budget issue is off base, or political.\" Other lawmakers further complained that the State Department has spent millions on lower-priority projects that could have been spent on security. Another pivotal issue Wednesday dealt with an Aug. 16 cable. That cable summarized an emergency meeting the day before by the U.S. Mission in Benghazi and warned the consulate could not defend against a \"coordinated attack.\" That cable is seen as one of the vital warnings sent out of Libya in the months leading up to the attack. But, to the dismay of lawmakers, Clinton repeatedly said she never saw it. \"That cable did not come to my attention. I have made it very clear that the security cables did not come to my attention or above the assistant secretary level,\" Clinton said. \"I'm not aware of anyone within my office, within the secretary's office, having seen the cable.\" Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said \"somebody within your office should have seen this cable.\" \"An emergency meeting was held and a cable sent out on Aug. 16 by the ambassador himself, warning of what could happen. And this meant this cable went unnoticed by your office. That's the bottom line,\" he said. Clinton said it was \"very disappointing\" that \"inadequacies\" were found in the \"responsiveness of our team here in Washington,\" and said \"it's something we're fixing and intend to put into place protocols and systems to make sure it doesn't happen again.\" The secretary tried to explain that \"1.43 million cables\" come through the department every year. They are addressed to her but in many cases do not go to her. Rather, they go through \"the bureaucracy.\" Republicans argue the Aug. 16 cable was rather high priority. As Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., put it, \"Libya has to have been one of the hottest of hot spots around the world.\" He claimed that not knowing about their security requests \"really, I think, cost these people their lives.\" \"Had I been president at the time, and I found that you did not read the cables from Benghazi, you did not read the cables from Ambassador Stevens, I would have relieved you of your post. I think it's inexcusable,\" Paul said.",

        "body": " Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he\u2019ll steer clear of the American presidential election, but he stars in a new ad set to air in the key battleground state of Florida that aims to make Iran a major campaign issue. Netanyahu, who has a famously frosty relationship with President Obama, mentions neither Obama nor Republican challenger Mitt Romney, with whom Netanyahu worked in the mid-1970s at Boston Consulting Group. His words are taken from a recent news conference, in which he expressed frustration at the Obama administration\u2019s failure to establish \u201cred lines\u201d for reining in Iran and its rogue nuclear weapons program. \"The fact is that every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to a nuclear bomb,\u201d Netanyahu says. \u201cThe world tells Israel, wait, there's still time. And I say wait for what? Wait until when?\" A voice-over at the end of the ad underscores the prime minister's message: \"The world needs American strength, not apologies.\" The ad, paid for by nonprofit conservative advocacy group Secure America Now, could have a powerful influence in heavily-Jewish markets, including Miami. Florida is considered a toss-up in recent polling, and its 29 electoral votes could swing the election. \u201cSizable majorities in both states believe that Iran will share nuclear weapons with terrorists,\u201d said Jeri Thompson, advisory board member for Secure America Now. \u201cSupport for Israel remains strong. In short, (Netanyahu's) a powerful messenger with a powerful message who the American people believe.\u201d The ad, reportedly to air in Miami, West Palm Beach and Fort Myers, is costing Secure America $1 million, the organization confirmed to Fox News. A Fox News poll released Wednesday shows Obama leading Romney, 49 percent to 44 percent, in Florida. Meanwhile, Haaretz reported that the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz aimed at Jewish voters in swing states. That campaign started Wednesday and runs through Nov. 5 in cable and broadcast TV markets in Florida, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania. \"This ad highlights the 'buyer's remorse' felt by many in the Jewish community, who voted for Obama four years ago but are now disillusioned with his economic policies and his policies toward Israel,\u201d the coalition's executive director, Matt Brooks, said in a written statement Wednesday. \u201cThese ads, and the stories of the people in them, give voice to the nagging doubts that many Jewish voters feel about President Obama. To underscore that point, numerous polls have shown an erosion in Jewish support for the president.\" Netanyahu also made an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" last Sunday, urging Obama to take a tougher line with Iran over its nuclear program. \"President Obama has said that he is determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons,\" he said on the Sunday morning show. \"If you're determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons, it means you'll act before they get nuclear weapons.\"",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 E-mails released by the White House on Wednesday revealed a fierce internal jostling over the government\u2019s official talking points in the aftermath of last September\u2019s attack in Benghazi, Libya, not only between the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency, but at the highest levels of the C.I.A. The 100 pages of e-mails showed a disagreement between David H. Petraeus, then the director of the C.I.A., and his deputy, Michael J. Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points, which were used by Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations, in television appearances days after the attack. Mr. Morell, administration officials said, deleted a reference in the draft version of the talking points to C.I.A. warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to because they feared it would reflect badly on them. Mr. Morell, officials said, acted on his own and not in response to pressure from the State Department. But when the final draft of the talking points was sent to Mr. Petraeus, he dismissed them, saying \u201cFrankly, I\u2019d just as soon not use this,\u201d adding that the heavily scrubbed account would not satisfy the House Democrat who had requested it. \u201cThis is certainly not what Vice Chairman Ruppersberger was hoping to get,\u201d Mr. Petraeus wrote, referring to Representative C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which had asked Mr. Petraeus for talking points to use with reporters in discussing the attack on Benghazi. The White House released the e-mails to reporters after Republicans seized on snippets of the correspondence that became public on Friday to suggest that President Obama\u2019s national security staff had been complicit in trying to alter the talking points for political reasons. While the e-mails portrayed White House officials as being sensitive to the concerns of the State Department, they suggest that Mr. Obama\u2019s aides mostly mediated a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the C.I.A. over how much to disclose \u2014 all under heavy time constraints because of the demands from Capitol Hill. The e-mails revealed no new details about the administration\u2019s evolving account of the Sept. 11 attack, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. \u201cIn recent days, these e-mails have been selectively and inaccurately read out to the media,\u201d said a White House spokesman, Eric Schultz. By releasing them, he said, the White House had shown that the drafting process was \u201cfocused on providing the facts as we knew them, based on the best information available at the time and protecting an ongoing investigation.\u201d Still, the final version of the talking points is stripped of material \u2014 including a reference to Libya being awash with weapons and fighters that made it a dangerous environment \u2014 which critics say would have raised questions about the State Department\u2019s security posture. Republicans welcomed the release of the e-mails, saying they confirmed that the administration had airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign. They also said the e-mails belied the White House\u2019s insistence that it had changed only one word in the talking points. \u201cThe seemingly political nature of the State Department\u2019s concerns raises questions about the motivations behind these changes and who at the State Department was seeking them,\u201d said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner. In releasing the e-mails, the White House was hoping to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate over the talking points. It drew attention to a draft of the talking points \u2014 the only document provided by the White House that was not part of an e-mail chain \u2014 in which Mr. Morell, in his own writing, crossed out five lines that referred to C.I.A. warnings about the threat of attacks by Al Qaeda-linked extremists in Benghazi and eastern Libya. But there is no other evidence in the e-mails that Mr. Morell himself objected to the inclusion of this material. In an e-mail to Mr. Petraeus accompanying the final version of the talking points, Mr. Morell referred to the State Department\u2019s deep concerns about the references. The release of the e-mails offers a rare glimpse inside the White House five days after the attack as it struggled to piece together intelligence to formulate a public account of what happened. The process began in earnest at 4:20 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 14, when Stephen W. Preston, the C.I.A. general counsel, sent an e-mail to other agency officials warning them not to disclose information that might interfere with the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation. At 6:20 p.m., the spokesman for the National Security Council at the time, Tommy Vietor, e-mailed to remind officials that Denis McDonough, then the deputy national security adviser and now the White House chief of staff, wanted to ensure that the edits were coordinated with the State Department. At 6:41 p.m., Shawn Turner, the spokesman for the director of national intelligence, suggested saying that on Sept. 10, the C.I.A. had \u201cnotified\u201d the American embassy in Cairo, not \u201cwarned\u201d it, of social media reports calling for a demonstration and encouraging jihadists to break into the embassy. Mr. Morell later removed the entire reference. At 7:16 p.m., Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, weighed in with her initial concerns about ensuring that the talking points provided to lawmakers did not go further than what the administration was telling reporters. Twenty-three minutes later, Ms. Nuland sent White House and intelligence officials an even more pointed e-mail, objecting that the talking points could be \u201cabused\u201d by lawmakers \u201cto beat the State Department for not paying attention to agency warnings so why do we want to feed that either? Concerned ... \u201d At 7:51 p.m., the F.B.I. offered only minor changes to the draft, the bureau\u2019s only suggestions during the contentious process. At 9:24 p.m., Ms. Nuland, reading the latest draft, complained in an e-mail, \u201cThese don\u2019t resolve all my issues or those of my building leadership.\u201d Ten minutes later, Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, offered his first comments, saying, \u201cWe need to resolve this in a way that respects all of the relevant equities, especially the investigation.\u201d In a report that set off the latest tempest over the talking points, ABC News reported incorrectly that Mr. Rhodes had emphasized the need to protect the State Department\u2019s interests. At 9:52 p.m., a C.I.A. spokesman e-mailed to other agency staff members a draft note intended for Mr. Petraeus, warning him that while the White House had quickly cleared the proposed talking points, the State Department had \u201cmajor concerns.\u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s national security deputies reviewed the talking points at a meeting the next day, Sept. 15, Mr. Rhodes said. At 11:25 a.m., Mr. Rhodes changed a reference to the United States \u201cconsulate\u201d in Benghazi to \u201cdiplomatic post.\u201d Over the next couple of hours, aides made small final changes and e-mailed a final version to lawmakers shortly after 3 p.m. With time short before Ms. Rice began taping her appearances on Sunday morning news programs, the White House also supplied her aides with the final talking points. Asked by one of Ms. Rice\u2019s aides, \u201cIs this the final language you want to use on Benghazi,\u201d Mr. Rhodes replied with a single word: \u201cYup.\u201d",

He indicated he was not shifting on his demand for more than $5 billion for funding for a wall on the southern border, saying it was necessary as the border is a \"dangerous, horrible disaster.\" \"This is national security we\u2019re talking about, we\u2019re not talking about games,\" he told reporters.  \u201cWe're not playing games, we have to do it.\" Despite Trump saying conversations had \"come a long way,\" Democrats were more dour in their assessment.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer exited saying Trump told them \"he\u2019d keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.\u201d Trump later confirmed in the Rose Garden, \"Absolutely I said that,\" while clarifying he hopes the partial shutdown doesn't last more than a few more days.  He said it could be opened \"very quickly\" if they come to an agreement on the wall.  He offered some flexibility only on what the wall would be made of, saying it could be concrete or steel. \"Steel is more expensive than the concrete, but I feel like we\u2019re talking about steel because the other side feels better about it,\" he said. Yet House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democrats' view is that they cannot resolve the funding dispute until the government fully opens.  She said there had been progress only in the sense of a \"better understanding\" of each other. Looking for an elusive resolution, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Trump agreed to designate staff to engage in negotiations with congressional leadership aides this weekend.  Trump later said the group would \"determine what we're going to do about the border.\"  That group would include Vice President Pence and advisor Jared Kushner. The meeting came on the 14th day of the shutdown, which was triggered by disagreements over the funding of Trump\u2019s promised wall, after Democrats formally took control of the House of Representatives.  Trump has said that $5 billion in funding for the wall is non-negotiable, while Democrats have said they will fund more general border security -- but not the wall. Trump met with Democratic and Republican leaders of both chambers.  Ahead of the meeting Trump sent a letter to members of Congress congratulating Pelosi on her election as speaker and calling on Congress to re-open the government. \u201cAs we begin this new Congress, our first task should be to reopen the Government and to deliver on our highest duty as elected officials: the security of the Nation and its borders,\" he said.  \u201cIt is the sovereign right of every nation to establish an immigration program in its national interest\u2014lawfully admitting those who have followed the rules, while denying entry to those who break the rules or fail to meet the requirements established in law.\" As part of his strategy, he made available to every member a presentation on border security that he said those present at a meeting Wednesday did not want to hear. \u201cAmericans have endured decades of broken promises on illegal immigration.  Now, is the time for both parties to rise above the partisan discord, to set aside political convenience, and to put the national interest first,\u201d he wrote. Democrats, meanwhile, passed legislation in the House that would fund the whole government, but not the wall.   Pelosi accused Republicans of holding government workers hostage for the separate demand of a wall. \"The wall and the government shutdown really have nothing to do with each other,\" Pelosi said at an MSNBC Town Hall. \"There is no reason to have workers pay a price with their paycheck,\" she said The legislation was immediately dismissed by Republican leadership.  McConnell, R-Ky., called the bills \u201ca time-wasting act of political posturing\u201d and said that \u201ca resolution will have to be palatable to House Democrats and Senate Republicans alike.\u201d \u201cWe need to make policy rather than simply making political theatre,\u201d he told reporters. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on \"Fox & Friends\" earlier Friday that it would be up to Pelosi to get her party behind her, including the left flank pushing for impeachment. \u201cWe think we're hopeful because the people that elected Nancy Pelosi didn't elect her to come up here and do nothing and didn't elect her to play political games,\u201d she said.  \u201cThey elected her to find real solutions and actually work with the president and work with all members of Congress to get things done.\u201d On Thursday night, Pence said on Fox News' \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d that the terms of the negotiations were clear: \"Bottom line, if there's no wall, there's no deal.\"",

All week, Mr. Trump has slowly escalated a war of words on Twitter against Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, his main competition in the Republican race, based on an ad by a \u201csuper PAC\u201d started by people who want to stop the New York developer from getting the nomination. The spot featured an old nude photo shoot of Mr. Trump\u2019s wife Melania Trump, a former model, posing on his jet. Mr. Cruz has no affiliation with the super PAC, and he has denounced the ad.

Under pressure from news outlets, the Republican Party tried to cauterize the wound that Mr. Akin had created by isolating him. Spouses are generally seen as off limits.

He did, as well, with Trump, whom he knew from New York's glitzy social circuit and from dealings with him as a developer.

He added, \u201cDonald Trump is not going to be the Republican nominee.\u201d Earlier in the campaign, GOP candidates signed a promise not to run as an independent if they were not nominated. The move was meant to convince voters that Trump would remain faithful to the Republican Party even if he lost. \u201cIt is garbage, complete and utter lies,\u201d Cruz said about the National Enquirer article alleging that he has had multiple affairs. \u201cIt is a tabloid smear, and it has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen.\u201d Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson responded to claims that she is one of the mystery women referred to in the article, stating on Twitter that the allegation is \u201cstupidity on all levels.\u201d \u201cOf course the National Enquirer story is 100 percent false!,\u201d Pierson tweeted. Of course the National Enquirer story is 100% FALSE!!! I only speak to myself, however. Earlier this year, the tabloid endorsed Trump for president with an issue that included an article giving ten reasons why the reality TV star is the \u201conly choice for the White House.\u201d The intensely personal feud between Cruz and Trump began earlier this week when a super PAC that opposes Trump posted a meme-style ad featuring a naked Melania Trump that Trump\u2019s then-girlfriend, a professional model, posed for more that 15 years ago for British GQ. Make America Awesome PAC paid for the ads and posted them on Facebook and Instagram. The photo features Mrs. Trump sprawled out naked on a fur rug inside a Boeing 727. The social media posts read, \u201cMeet Melania Trump. Your next First Lady. Or you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.\u201d An angry Trump lashed out at Cruz on Twitter, calling the senator a liar, as he has alleged before in the campaign, and threatening to \u201cspill the beans\u201d about Cruz's wife Heidi. \u201cLyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a GQ shoot in his ad,\u201d Trump said on the social media site. \u201cBe careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!\u201d Cruz quickly retorted by saying that the ads did not come not from his campaign, and called Trump a \u201ccoward\u201d threatening to go after his wife. \u201cPic of your wife not from us,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cDonald, if you try to attack Heidi, you're more of a coward than I thought. #classless.\u201d The lurch into the sort of personal territory that's normally off limits in campaigns occurred as an anti-Trump super PAC began running an ad in primary states featuring women reciting comments made by the billionaire that are derogatory toward women.

The legislation would give the president \u201cfast-track\u201d authority to approve pending trade deals with 11 Pacific Rim nations. The measure also allows Congress to approve or reject such deals, but not amend them. Courting Iowa voters, Clinton sought to address Democratic opponents of the trade legislation, including liberals and labor unions, who have said the Obama-backed plan will cost U.S. jobs. The agreement has not been finalized or submitted to Congress. \"The president should listen to and work with his allies in Congress, starting with Nancy Pelosi, who had expressed their concerns about the impact that a weak agreement would have on our workers to make sure we get the best strongest deal possible,\" Clinton said. \"And if we don't get it, there should be no deal.\" The White House and Republican leaders in Congress now face long odds in trying to revive the trade legislation after congressional Democrats helped defeat a job retraining program to jeopardize Obama's attempt to secure the fast-track authority.

Bernie Sanders, who was campaigning in Iowa on Sunday, has opposed the trade deal and questioned Clinton's refusal to say where she stood. \"It is a failed trade policy, and I would hope that the Secretary joins Elizabeth Warren, and vast majority of Democrats in the Congress in saying, \u2018No, we've got to defeat this piece of legislation,\u2019 \u201d Sanders said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley has also opposed the deal. In a sign of its resonance within the party, his campaign noted in an email to supporters Saturday that Clinton's speech in New York didn't \"weigh in on the secretive TPP deal that could depress American wages and cost American jobs.\" The Obama administration has said it remains confident there are ways to get the trade provisions through Congress. Republican leaders generally support Obama's trade proposal and have suggested they may try to revive the bill as early as this week. \"Republicans delivered,\" Wisconsin GOP Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"The question is: Are the Democrats going to do this to their president?\" While Clinton called the pact the \"gold standard\" of trade agreements while serving as secretary of state, she has refused to take a position on the deal since announcing her candidacy. That brought criticism from Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short on Sunday. \"By waffling on a trade deal she helped negotiate and once called a \"gold standard,\" Hillary Clinton continues to show why voters overwhelmingly see her as dishonest and untrustworthy,\" Short said in a statement. Clinton was spending most of the weekend in Iowa after formally launching her campaign in New York City, seeking to build an organizational edge in the state that tripped up her first presidential campaign against Obama. Sanders was campaigning across the state and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, who is exploring a potential Democratic bid, also was holding events in Iowa on Sunday. O'Malley held a day's events in the state last week. Earlier in the day, top Clinton advisers, including senior spokeswoman Karen Finney, said that Clinton is waiting to see the final deal and that she has explained her position in recent weeks. \"We\u2019ll see where this process goes,\" Finney told Fox News. \"This is someone who has voted for trade agreements when they have been good for the country and against trade agreements when she thought they were bad for the country.\" Campaign Chairman John Podesta told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Clinton \u201chas a clear standard that (the deal) has got to be good for American workers or she thinks the United States should walk away from it.\u201d",

Almost 14 months after the election, Mr. Trump has kept up a regular drumbeat of attacks on Mrs. Clinton. Last year, Mr. Trump also criticized the Justice Department and Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not pursuing investigations of his political opponents. The Twitter post on Tuesday morning followed an article in The Daily Caller, a conservative publication that Mr. Trump closely monitors. The article said the aide, Huma Abedin, forwarded some government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009, when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, which affected all three billion of its accounts. After the breach, the data was offered for sale by a hacking collective based in Eastern Europe. Mr. Trump also implored his administration to investigate Ms. Abedin. The term \u201cdeep state\u201d typically refers to a shadow government of agency officials who secretly plot to influence policy; they are usually associated with countries that have authoritarian elements that undercut democratically elected leaders. On Friday, the State Department released about 3,000 of Ms. Abedin\u2019s work-related emails. The emails were found on the laptop of Ms. Abedin\u2019s now estranged husband, Anthony D. Weiner, and were released as part of a public records request. The emails found on Mr. Weiner\u2019s computer are a sore spot for Mrs. Clinton. James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, had notified Congress shortly before the 2016 election about the existence of newly discovered emails that could be relevant to the closed investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton, in a book released last year, said Mr. Comey\u2019s disclosure hurt her campaign\u2019s momentum and helped Mr. Trump win the election. In his Twitter post, Mr. Trump also referred to the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine. According to a report in Fox News, the sailor had hoped to receive a pardon from the president, but has not.",

        "body": " KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 Leaders of the country's largest civil rights organization accused tea party activists on Tuesday of tolerating bigotry and approved a resolution condemning racism within the political movement. The resolution was adopted during the annual convention in Kansas City of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, spokesman Chris Fleming said. Tea party organizers disputed claims of racism and called on the NAACP to withdraw the resolution. Debate was mostly closed to the public, but the final version \"calls on the tea party and all people of good will to repudiate the racist element and activities within the tea party,\" said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau. \"I hope it will empower the tea party to actually look at itself and see that there are those who are noticing things that I think most tea partiers don't want,\" he said. Sarah Palin, a vocal tea party supporter, said in a statement late Tuesday that she was \"saddened by the NAACP's claim that patriotic Americans ... are somehow 'racists.'\" The former Alaska governor said claims that tea party activists \"judge people by the color of their skin\" were false and appalling. The final wording won't be released until the NAACP's national board of directors approves the resolution during its meeting in October. But the original called for the NAACP to \"educate its membership and the community that this movement is not just about higher taxes and limited government.\" It said something could evolve \"and become more dangerous for that small percentage of people that really think our country has been taken away from them.\" \"We felt the time had come to stand up and say, 'It's time for the tea party to be responsible members of this democracy and make sure they don't tolerate bigots or bigotry among their members,'\" NAACP President Ben Jealous said ahead of the debate. \"We don't have a problem with the tea party's existence. We have an issue with their acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists into their organizations,\" he said. Tea party activist Alex Poulter, who co-founded a Kansas City-area group called Political Chips, also disputed the allegations. He said the movement is made up of a \"diverse group of folks who are upset with what is going on with this country.\" Poulter said he has seen no evidence of racism within the movement. \"It's unfounded, but people are running with these accusations like they are true,\" he said. A group called the St. Louis Tea Party issued its own resolution Tuesday calling on the NAACP to withdraw the proposal. Though not affiliated with either major political party, tea party activists espouse a political philosophy of less government, a free market, lower taxes, individual rights and political activism. The group has faced occasional claims of racism, most notably in March near the end of the bitter health care debate. U.S. Reps. John Lewis, Andre Carson and Emanuel Cleaver said some demonstrators, many of them tea party activists, yelled a racial epithet as the black congressmen walked from House office buildings to the Capitol. Cleaver, D-Mo., also said he was spit on. A white lawmaker said he also heard the epithets, but conservative activists said the lawmakers were lying. \"They are pulling people together and focusing on the negative, and then it's hard to make anything positive out of that,\" said Anita L. Russell, president of the Kansas City, Mo., branch of the NAACP, which introduced the resolution. \"And then these groups, these extremist groups, are looking for something, and they are latching on to this.\"",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, drew fierce criticism and a call for his resignation on Friday after declaring at a party fund-raiser that the United States was on the wrong side of history with its conflict in Afghanistan, a military fight he called \u201ca war of Obama\u2019s choosing.\u201d \u201cThis is not something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in,\u201d Mr. Steele said in a speech Thursday night in Connecticut in which he offered a strong critique of President Obama\u2019s military strategy. \u201cIt was the president who was trying to be cute by half by flipping a script demonizing Iraq, while saying the battle really should be Afghanistan,\u201d Mr. Steele said, according to a video of his remarks that was circulated by Democrats on Friday. \u201cWell, if he\u2019s such a student of history, has he not understood that you know that\u2019s the one thing you don\u2019t do, is engage in a land war in Afghanistan?\u201d Mr. Steele, seeking to clarify his remarks, issued a statement on Friday afternoon, saying, \u201cThere is no question that America must win the war on terror.\u201d His remarks were the latest in a string of controversial statements that he has made as party chairman. The war in Afghanistan, which has entered its ninth year, was started by former President George W. Bush in response to the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Obama shifted the focus on the war on terrorism from Iraq to Afghanistan and last year announced his plan to send 30,000 more troops there. Mr. Steele\u2019s comments prompted William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard and a leading voice of conservative support for the war in Afghanistan, to call for Mr. Steele\u2019s resignation as party leader. \u201cYour tenure has, of course, been marked by gaffes and embarrassments, but I for one have never paid much attention to them, and have never thought they would matter much to the success of the causes and principles we share,\u201d Mr. Kristol wrote Friday. He added, \u201cNeedless to say, the war in Afghanistan was not \u2018a war of Obama\u2019s choosing.\u2019 It has been prosecuted by the United States under Presidents Bush and Obama.\u201d He added, \u201cThere are, of course, those who think we should pull out of Afghanistan, and they\u2019re certainly entitled to make their case. But one of them shouldn\u2019t be the chairman of the Republican Party.\u201d A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, Brad Woodhouse, said Mr. Steele was \u201cbetting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan.\u201d Republican officials dismissed that criticism. When Mr. Steele made the remarks, he was speaking to Republican contributors at a fund-raiser in Connecticut. Linda McMahon, the party\u2019s candidate for the United States Senate in Connecticut, was in the audience, along with other leading state Republicans. The video appears to have been taken by a hidden camera at an event that was closed to the press. Republican officials did not dispute the authenticity of the video, but disputed its characterization. In his statement on Friday afternoon, Mr. Steele did not respond to the call for his resignation. But he sought to make the case that Afghanistan is now Mr. Obama\u2019s war. \u201cFor the sake of the security of the free world, our country must give our troops the support necessary to win this war,\u201d Mr. Steele said. \u201cAs we have learned throughout history, winning a war in Afghanistan is a difficult task. We must also remember that after the tragedy of Sept. 11, 2001, it is also a necessary one.\u201d He added, with a reference to Gen. David H. Petraeus: \u201cThat is why I supported the decision to increase our troop force and, like the entire United States Senate, I support General Petraeus\u2019s confirmation. The stakes are too high for us to accept anything but success in Afghanistan.\u201d",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Susan E. Rice, President Obama\u2019s national security adviser, sharply criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Tuesday over his plans to address a joint meeting of Congress next week, saying his actions had hurt his nation\u2019s relationship with the United States. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s decision to travel to Washington to deliver the speech two weeks before the Israeli elections has \u201cinjected a degree of partisanship, which is not only unfortunate, I think it\u2019s destructive of the fabric of the relationship,\u201d Ms. Rice said in an interview on the PBS television program \u201cCharlie Rose.\u201d Her comments marked the strongest public rebuke to date by the Obama administration since Mr. Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Speaker John A. Boehner to make his case to Congress against a nuclear deal with Iran, which is a priority of Mr. Obama\u2019s. It is also the frankest acknowledgment yet by a top American official of the degree to which the controversy has damaged United States-Israeli relations. The speech, scheduled for March 3, was arranged by Mr. Boehner and the Israeli ambassador without consulting the White House \u2014 a move that Mr. Obama\u2019s team has called a breach of protocol. The president has said he will not meet with Mr. Netanyahu during his visit to avoid any appearance that he is trying to influence the Israeli elections that are scheduled for mid-March. The episode is a low point in the tense relationship between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu and has touched off weeks of mostly anonymous sniping and finger-pointing. Top administration officials have hinted more openly of their displeasure in recent days. The White House on Wednesday said that Mr. Obama agreed with Ms. Rice\u2019s assessment, saying he had raised the same concerns several times. Her comments, said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, are \u201centirely consistent with what the president has already said.\u201d \u201cAllowing this relationship to be subjected to party politics does weaken the relationship,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. Mr. Earnest said he did not know whether Mr. Obama and Ms. Rice had talked in advance of the interview about what she would say about Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s visit. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who as president of the Senate would be expected to attend, has said he will be traveling abroad. Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday that he would be in Switzerland negotiating with the Iranians. The White House has also not committed to sending a representative next week to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u2019s conference, where Mr. Netanyahu is also scheduled to appear. The Israeli prime minister himself has turned down a request by Democratic senators for a private meeting, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said Tuesday. \u201cWe offered the prime minister an opportunity to balance the politically divisive invitation from Speaker Boehner with a private meeting with Democrats who are committed to keeping the bipartisan support of Israel strong,\u201d Mr. Durbin said in a statement. \u201cHis refusal to meet is disappointing to those of us who have stood by Israel for decades.\u201d In a letter released by Mr. Durbin\u2019s office, Mr. Netanyahu said such a meeting \u201ccould compound the misperception of partisanship regarding my upcoming visit.\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said Tuesday that he was making the trip because it was his obligation to \u201cdo everything I can to prevent\u201d a nuclear agreement with Iran. \u201cTherefore, I will go to Washington to address the American Congress, because the American Congress is likely to be the final brake before the agreement between the major powers and Iran,\u201d he said as he toured a military base in southern Israel. Ms. Rice demurred when asked whether she believed Mr. Netanyahu was making the speech to gain political favor. \u201cI\u2019m not going to ascribe motives to the prime minister,\u201d she told Mr. Rose. \u201cThe point is, we want the relationship between the United States and Israel to be unquestionably strong, immutable, regardless of political seasons in either country, regardless of which party may be in charge in either country. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked very hard to have that,\u201d she said, \u201cand we will work very hard to maintain that.\u201d",

The ruling allows homosexual couples to receive the same tax benefits that heterosexual couples do when filing jointly. Thursday\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of a historic decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned a part of the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year. Questions were raised following the high court\u2019s decision on how the federal government would treat same-sex couples whose home states don\u2019t recognize gay marriage. The rules issued Thursday said the policies would affect all legally married gay couples regardless of where they live. The rules, though, would not apply to domestic partnerships and civil unions. \"Today's ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide. It provides access to benefits, responsibilities and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve,\" Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said in a written statement. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said that, because of today\u2019s ruling, \u201ccommitted and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nation\u2019s federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home.\u201d He added, \u201cThese families finally have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act.\u201d Not everyone was on board with the decision. Brian Brown, president of the National Organization of Marriage, believes that giving same sex couples the right to file jointly \u201ccontinues a pattern of lawlessness\u201d across the country. \"The Obama administration is intent on forcing same-sex 'marriage' on an unwilling public,\" Brown said in a written statement. \"Congress alone has the responsibility of determining federal tax law.\"",

Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., made the request in a letter sent Tuesday to Clinton's lawyer. Gowdy asked that Clinton agree to a \"transcribed\" interview -- and repeated a March 16 request for her to surrender her server so it can be examined by the State Department\u2019s inspector general. Gowdy said Friday that Clinton, the presumptive Democratic front-runner in the 2016 presidential race, has yet to adequately respond to the subpoena request for the server.

Gowdy suggested Monday that he wants to have \"separate conversations\" with Clinton about Benghazi and the emails, in light of her wiping clean the server. \"I need to ask what she did (with the server) and when she did it and importantly why she did it,\u201d he said on Fox News' \"On the Record with Greta Van Susteren.\" He also suggested on the show and in the letter that efforts to get Clinton to comply with the requests might require the full weight of the Republican-led House and that he will confer with House Speaker John Boehner about whether another committee will be involved.

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The Internal Revenue Service official who first disclosed that the agency had targeted conservative groups for special scrutiny, and in doing so ignited a controversy that has ensnared the White House, denied on Wednesday that she had ever provided false information to Congress. She then invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to testify at a House hearing on the agency\u2019s actions. As the official, Lois Lerner, appeared under subpoena before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, she sternly told her questioners that accusations that she had misled Congress in previous testimony were false. \u201cI have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws,\u201d said Ms. Lerner, who leads the I.R.S.\u2019s division on tax-exempt organizations. \u201cI have not violated any I.R.S. rules and regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other Congressional committee.\u201d Ms. Lerner has become a person of intense interest to Congressional investigators, who insist that she made, at best, incomplete statements when she said she first learned that her subordinates had singled out Tea Party groups after reading news media reports last year. An inspector general\u2019s report found, however, that she was briefed on their actions as early as June 2011. After she refused on Wednesday to say anything more to the committee, despite attempts by Representative Darrell Issa of California, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, to persuade her otherwise, Mr. Issa tried to dismiss her and her lawyer. But that upset other Republicans, who said that Ms. Lerner should not be let go so quickly. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to tell your side of the story and then not be subjected to cross-examination,\u201d said Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina. \u201cShe ought to stand here and answer our questions.\u201d Mr. Issa made a second attempt to persuade her to change her mind. But when she declined, he dismissed her again. Ms. Lerner then left the hearing room with her lawyer to a whir of camera shutters. That exchange set the tone for a contentious hearing that veered into veiled accusations that the White House had a larger role in the controversy than previously disclosed, as well as outright attacks on President Obama\u2019s character. Mr. Issa said he reserved the right to recall Ms. Lerner later. And he may elect to do so, given the objections of some Republicans on Wednesday after he dismissed her. They argued that by making an opening statement, she had waived her Fifth Amendment right and could be compelled to testify, a contention Ms. Lerner\u2019s lawyer disputed. The committee also heard testimony from Douglas H. Shulman, the former I.R.S. commissioner; Neal S. Wolin, the deputy secretary of the Treasury Department; and J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general who looked into the accusations of targeting. And as the hearing continued, Republicans and Democrats pressed ahead with one point on which they agree these days: that an inept I.R.S. had committed serious misdeeds. \u201cThe power to tax is the power to destroy,\u201d Mr. Issa said. Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the committee, also scolded the agency. \u201cI believe there was gross incompetence and mismanagement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are better than that. We are simply better than that.\u201d But Mr. Cummings also admonished his Republican colleagues. \u201cI think we need to be very, very careful not to let partisanship undermine the integrity not only of the committee but our investigation and our work product,\u201d he said. The hearing, the second this week on the I.R.S.\u2019s efforts to target conservative groups, offered few new revelations. Mr. George did shed some light on the extent of the accusations against the I.R.S., saying that at this point in this investigation he had no reason to believe any illegal conduct occurred. \u201cWe do not deem it illegal. We do not believe that it was illegal, what they did,\u201d he said. At times, committee members could hardly conceal their contempt for the I.R.S. and the Obama White House. Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, tried to link the I.R.S. scandal with other controversies that are dogging the Obama administration. \u201cThis administration, which told us and told the American people that the attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi was the work, was caused by a video, is now the same administration who expects us to believe that this scandal was just the result of two rogue agents in Cincinnati,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people don\u2019t buy it.\u201d Representative James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, said the way that applicants for tax-exempt status were buried in I.R.S. paperwork reminded him of another sore point that Republicans have with the Obama administration. \u201cMan, that sounds like the Keystone Pipeline to me,\u201d he said, referring to the proposed cross-country oil pipeline that the president has so far declined to approve. One Democrat, Representative Stephen F. Lynch of Massachusetts, even raised the threat of appointing a special prosecutor if Congress continues to feel that the I.R.S. is not being straightforward. \u201cWe know where that will lead. It will lead to a special prosecutor,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be hell to pay if that\u2019s the route we choose to go down.\u201d Later, Mr. Jordan pressed Mr. Shulman, the former I.R.S. commissioner, on whether he had visited the White House. When Mr. Shulman said he had, Mr. Jordan produced White House visitor records that he said indicated Mr. Shulman had been there at least 118 times. Was he sure, Mr. Jordan asked, that the I.R.S. targeting never came up? \u201cOne hundred-eighteen visits and it didn\u2019t come up in casual conversation?\u201d Mr. Jordan said. In follow-up questioning by Representative Gerald E. Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, Mr. Shulman offered what he said was one of the many plausible explanations why he would have visited the White House. \u201cThe Easter Egg Roll with my kids,\u201d he said.",

The group even went so far as to link Schiff to leaked information about the investigation. \u201cYour willingness to continue to promote a demonstrably false narrative is alarming,\u201d they said, joining other top Republican lawmakers demanding Schiff\u2019s ouster. Trump himself called on Schiff to resign Thursday in an early-morning tweet that accused the chairman of \u201cunlawfully lying and leaking\u201d information. The president said Schiff should be \u201cforced\u201d to step down from Congress entirely. Somewhat misleadingly, the GOP committee members stated in their letter that Mueller\u2019s findings \u201cconclusively refute\u201d Schiff\u2019s \u201cpast and present assertions\u201d about the investigation. While Mueller says his report \u201cdoes not conclude that the President committed a crime,\u201d it \u201calso does not exonerate him.\u201d Questions about what the full report uncovered are still at the forefront of many Democrats\u2019 minds, and the party is uniformly calling for the Justice Department to release it publicly. The Intelligence Committee Republicans\u2019 letter concluded, \u201cYour actions both past and present are incompatible with your duty as Chairman of this Committee, which alone in the House of Representatives has the obligation and authority to provide effective oversight of the U.S. intelligence community.\u201d Schiff, in response to his critics, doubled down on his questions about the special counsel\u2019s investigation, which indicted more than 30 people \u2015 including several close to Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s OK,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cI think it\u2019s immoral. I think it\u2019s unethical. I think it\u2019s unpatriotic, and yes, I think it\u2019s corrupt and evidence of collusion.\u201d",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump declared a national emergency on the border with Mexico on Friday in order to access billions of dollars that Congress refused to give him to build a wall there, transforming a highly charged policy dispute into a confrontation over the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution. Trying to regain momentum after losing a grinding two-month battle with lawmakers over funding the wall, Mr. Trump asserted that the flow of drugs, criminals and illegal immigrants from Mexico constituted a profound threat to national security that justified unilateral action. \u201cWe\u2019re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we\u2019re going to do it one way or the other,\u201d he said in a televised statement in the Rose Garden barely 13 hours after Congress passed a spending measure without the money he had sought. \u201cIt\u2019s an invasion,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.\u201d But with illegal border crossings already down and critics accusing him of manufacturing a crisis, he may have undercut his own argument that the border situation was so urgent that it required emergency action. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to do this, but I\u2019d rather do it much faster,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to get it done faster, that\u2019s all.\u201d The president\u2019s decision incited instant condemnation from Democrats, who called it an unconstitutional abuse of his authority and vowed to try to overturn it with the support of Republicans who also objected to the move. \u201cThis is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a joint statement. Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement came during a freewheeling, 50-minute appearance in which he ping-ponged from topic to topic, touching on the economy, China trade talks and his coming summit meeting with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. The president again suggested that he should win the Nobel Peace Prize, and he reviewed which conservative commentators had been supportive of him, while dismissing Ann Coulter, who has not. Sounding alternately defensive and aggrieved, Mr. Trump explained his failure to secure wall funding during his first two years in office when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress by saying, \u201cI was a little new to the job.\u201d He blamed \u201ccertain people, a particular one, for not having pushed this faster,\u201d a clear reference to former Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican. Mr. Trump\u2019s assertions were replete with misinformation and, when challenged by reporters, he refused to accept statistics produced by his own government that conflicted with his narrative. \u201cThe numbers that you gave are wrong,\u201d he told one reporter. \u201cIt\u2019s a fake question.\u201d On point after point, the president insisted that he would be proved correct. \u201cPeople said, \u2018Trump is crazy,\u2019\u201d he said at one point, discussing his outreach to Mr. Kim. \u201cAnd you know what it ended up being? A very good relationship.\u201d Mr. Trump acknowledged that his declaration of a national emergency would be litigated in the courts and even predicted a rough road for his side. \u201cLook, I expect to be sued,\u201d he said, launching into a mocking riff about how he anticipated lower court rulings against him. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll win in the Supreme Court,\u201d he predicted. Indeed, Public Citizen, an advocacy group, filed suit by the end of the day on behalf of three Texas landowners whose property might be taken for a barrier. California and New York likewise announced that they will sue over what Gov. Gavin Newsom of California called the president\u2019s \u201cvanity project,\u201d and a roster of other groups lined up to do the same. \u201cFortunately, Donald Trump is not the last word,\u201d said Mr. Newsom, a Democrat. \u201cThe courts will be the last word.\u201d Among those predicting a flurry of judicial decisions against Mr. Trump was George T. Conway III, a conservative lawyer and the husband of Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s counselor. \u201cIf he knows he is going to lose,\u201d Mr. Conway, a vocal critic of Mr. Trump, wrote on Twitter, \u201cthen he knows he is violating the Constitution and laws he has sworn to uphold.\u201d The House Judiciary Committee announced Friday that it would investigate the president\u2019s emergency claim, while House Democrats plan to introduce legislation to block it. That measure could pass both houses of Congress if it wins the votes of the half-dozen Republican senators who have criticized the declaration, forcing Mr. Trump to issue the first veto of his presidency. The emergency declaration, according to White House officials, enables the president to divert $3.6 billion from military construction projects to the wall. Mr. Trump will also use more traditional presidential discretion to tap $2.5 billion from counternarcotics programs and $600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund. Combined with $1.375 billion authorized for fencing in the spending package passed on Thursday night, Mr. Trump would have about $8 billion in all for barriers, significantly more than the $5.7 billion he unsuccessfully demanded from Congress. The president opted not to tap hurricane relief money from Texas or Puerto Rico, an idea that had generated angry complaints from Republicans. But he expressed no concern that diverting military construction money would delay projects benefiting the troops like base housing, schools and gyms. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sound too important to me,\u201d he said. Neither the White House nor the Pentagon had yet identified which projects may be shelved as a result, but Pentagon lawyers and other officials planned to work over the weekend to identify which construction funds would be diverted. The declaration also provided that land may be transferred to the Defense Department from other federal agencies or from privately purchased or condemned land. The next step would be to secure those lands, where the Pentagon would erect barriers. The declaration gives Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, broad latitude to carry out this process. Most Americans oppose Mr. Trump\u2019s emergency declaration, according to polls. One released this week by Fox News found 56 percent against it, including 20 percent of Republicans. Mr. Trump\u2019s desire for approval by Fox and other conservative news outlets was on display when he identified various pundits as supporters, naming Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson and Rush Limbaugh, although he insisted that \u201cthey don\u2019t decide policy.\u201d But Ms. Coulter, who has viscerally attacked Mr. Trump for caving on the wall, has clearly gotten under his skin. \u201cI don\u2019t know her,\u201d he said before quickly correcting himself. \u201cI hardly know her. I haven\u2019t spoken to her in way over a year.\u201d He noted, though, that she was an early predictor of his election victory. \u201cSo I like her, but she\u2019s off the reservation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut anybody that knows her understands that.\u201d Ms. Coulter fired back shortly afterward. \u201cThe only national emergency is that our president is an idiot,\u201d she said on KABC radio in Los Angeles. White House officials rejected criticism from across the ideological spectrum that Mr. Trump was creating a precedent that future presidents could use to ignore the will of Congress. Republicans have expressed concern that a Democratic commander in chief could cite Mr. Trump\u2019s move to declare a national emergency over gun violence or climate change without legislation from Congress. \u201cIt actually creates zero precedent,\u201d Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told reporters. \u201cThis is authority given to the president in law already. It\u2019s not as if he just didn\u2019t get what he wanted so he\u2019s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money.\u201d Presidents have declared national emergencies under a 1970s-era law about five dozen times, and 31 of those prior emergencies remain active. But most of them dealt with foreign crises and involved freezing property, blocking trade or exports or taking other actions against national adversaries, not redirecting money without explicit congressional authorization. White House officials cited only two times that such emergency declarations were used by presidents to spend money without legislative approval \u2014 once by President George Bush in 1990 during the run-up to the Persian Gulf war, and again by his son, President George W. Bush, in 2001 after the terrorist attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. In both of those cases, the presidents were responding to new events \u2014 the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Al Qaeda\u2019s assault on the United States \u2014 and were moving military funds around for a military purposes. Neither was taking action specifically rejected by Congress. In Mr. Trump\u2019s case, he is defining a longstanding problem at the border as an emergency even though border apprehensions have actually fallen in recent years, to 400,000 in the last fiscal year from a peak of 1.6 million in the 2000 fiscal year. And unlike either of the Bushes, he is taking action after failing to persuade lawmakers to go along with his plans through the regular appropriations process. The spending package passed Thursday by Congress included none of the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump demanded for 234 miles of steel wall. Instead, it provided $1.375 billion for about 55 miles of fencing. Mr. Trump signed the package into law on Friday anyway to avoid a second government shutdown after the impasse over border wall funding closed the doors of many federal agencies for 35 days and left 800,000 workers without pay. For weeks, Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky urged Mr. Trump not to declare a national emergency, but the president opted to go ahead anyway to find a way out of the political corner he had put himself in with the failed effort to force Congress to finance the wall. Mr. McConnell privately told the president that he would support the move despite his own reservations, but warned Mr. Trump that he had about two weeks to win over critical Republicans to avoid having Congress vote to reject the declaration. Mr. Trump was among those Republicans who criticized President Barack Obama for using his executive authority to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation after failing to persuade Congress to do so. \u201cRepubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit & because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted in 2014. But Mr. Trump sought to drive home the personal toll of illegal immigration, inviting to the Rose Garden several relatives of Americans killed by people in the country without authorization. Some of the relatives, known as \u201cangel moms,\u201d stood up holding pictures of loved ones who had died. \u201cMatthew\u2019s death was preventable and should have been prevented,\u201d one of the women, Maureen Maloney, said in an interview after the event. Her son Matthew Denice, 23, was killed in 2011 in a motorcycle accident in Massachusetts after colliding with an automobile driven by an undocumented immigrant. \u201cHe should have never been here in the first place,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t here, it wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d",

        "body": " In one of the highest-profile showdowns between establishment Republicans and Tea Party conservatives so far this year, Rep. Raul Labrador said Friday that he is challenging Rep. Kevin McCarthy for the House majority leader position that became open this week. Labrador, of Idaho, would be the Tea Party alternative to McCarthy, who is the whip and is favored by establishment Republicans. Only in Congress since 2010, Labrador would represent several firsts: the first Latino, first Mormon and first Idaho lawmaker to be House majority leader. Labrador\u2019s foray into the race for majority leader is yet another dramatic turn of events for Republicans, who were stunned by the defeat in Tuesday\u2019s primary in Virginia of Rep. Eric Cantor to a Tea Party candidate who cast the congressman as someone who embraces the status quo of Beltway GOP politics and did not truly represent his constituents. Americans don\u2019t believe their leaders in Washington are listening and now is the time to change that. And it upends the June 19 voting by the House Republicans for majority leader. On Friday morning, McCarthy, 49, appeared to be headed toward running unopposed after some rivals dropped out. \u201cI was stunned when Eric Cantor lost his primary election earlier this week,\u201d Labrador, who is 46, said in his announcement about running for majority leader. \u201cEric is a good friend and I have tremendous respect for him. But the message from Tuesday is clear \u2013 Americans are looking for a change in the status quo.\u201d Some conservatives in the House were pushing for a postponement of the June 19 election for majority leader, saying they wanted more time to put someone with more right-wing views in the running for the position. \u201cI want a\u2026leadership team that can bring the Republican conference together,\u201d Labrador said in his statement, \u201cA leadership team that can help unite and grow our party. Americans don\u2019t believe their leaders in Washington are listening and now is the time to change that.\u201d Some lawmakers pressed Labrador to run, according to several published reports that quoted unnamed sources. Economics professor Dave Brat, the Tea Party candidate who defeated Cantor, attacked the congressman as soft on border security and on people who come here illegally. Cantor, who had once been more moderate on immigration issues \u2013 particularly on the bitterly divisive aspect of whether to give undocumented immigrants already in the U.S. a chance to legalize their status \u2013 shifted sharply to a hard line position, saying he would block any effort in the House to consider proposals to give such immigrants a break. But some observers said Cantor\u2019s tough stance toward the end of the primary \u2013 one he\u2019d seemed confident he\u2019d easily win \u2013 was too little too late. Others say it was Cantor\u2019s lack of popularity in general in his district, and his lackluster campaign, that doomed him. Nonetheless, many see the next majority leader as potentially influencing the House handling of immigration reform, which stalled as conservative members said they would not support a comprehensive measure for an overhaul of the system, and especially not one that, in their view, would grant amnesty to lawbreakers. The Senate last year passed a sweeping bipartisan immigration reform bill that both tightened border security and provided a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who meet a strict set of criteria. McCarthy, whose district is 35 percent Latino, has expressed support for providing a path to legal status, but only after those applying for it earn it by learning English and paying fines and taxes, among other things. Labrador, who worked as an immigration attorney before serving in Congress, was part of a bipartisan group in the House that was working on a reform bill. But Labrador famously quit the group because of a disagreement with its other members over whether to entitle undocumented immigrants to some form of healthcare. Labrador has not been shy about criticizing House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, saying that he should step down if he allows a vote on an immigration bill this year. The Idaho congressman, echoing other conservatives, has said that Congress should wait until at least 2015 to take up the issue again because President Obama must make a clear attempt to take steps to secure the borders and step up interior enforcement of immigration laws. He has said he will not back a version of the Senate reform bill, and prefers to deal with the subject in a piecemeal fashion. Labrador supports a path to legal status, but only after evidence that enforcement has been improved, he has said. He also supports expanding foreign worker visa programs. Labrador says this about himself on his website: \u201cBorn to a single mother in Puerto Rico, Ra\u00fal Labrador moved with his mother to the mainland U.S. at age 13.\u201d \u201cHis mother worked many different jobs to make ends meet,\u201d it says. \u201cThough times were tough, Ra\u00fal\u2019s mother often reminded him that if he studied, worked hard, and played by the rules, he could achieve the American Dream. This encouraged Ra\u00fal to never give up on his professional aspirations and personal dreams.\u201d One of the conservative members in the House who wanted to postpone the June 19 vote for majority leader quickly indicated that for him, Labrador would not do. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), tweeted on Friday \"#Labrador is pro amnesty. If not this year, he has strongly advocated for amnesty next year. No fair trying to redefine amnesty.\u201d",

Now arrives the hour of action,\u201d he said. The president addressed a packed crowd of spectators stretching from the Capitol across the National Mall on a mild but overcast and at-times drizzly day, after taking the oath of office along with Vice President Mike Pence.  The speech did not delve into policy details, and rather reprised objectives from his 2016 campaign on trade, immigration and national security. But the address was stitched together, more broadly, by an appeal for a \u201cnew national pride\u201d and a rediscovery of American patriotism, as he described this as a salve for the country\u2019s divisions. \u201cWhen you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice,\u201d he said. He also rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while \u201cthe people did not share\u201d in Washington\u2019s wealth. The address completes Trump\u2019s remarkable journey from political outsider written off by countless Beltway pundits to the most powerful man in the country. His campaign manager Kellyanne Conway noted in an earlier interview with Fox News that Trump was \u201cmaking history\u201d as a businessman with no prior political or military experience \u2013 someone successful in the private sector coming to Washington \u201cowing nobody anything.\u201d In blunt and unvarnished terms similar to the language used during his nomination acceptance address last summer, Trump on Friday lamented the jobs lost to foreign rivals \u2013 he described \u201crusted out factories scattered like tombstones\u201d across the land \u2013 and the crime in America\u2019s cities. \u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\u201d Trump said. Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people and vowed never to let them down. \u201cFrom this day forward, it\u2019s going to be only America first,\u201d Trump said.  \u201cI will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down. \u2026  We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.\u201d He also vowed to eradicate Islamic terrorism. Telling the American people this is \u201cyour moment\u201d and \u201cyour day,\u201d Trump closed his speech with the promise that started it all: \u201cWe will make America great again.\u201d As Barack and Michelle Obama depart the White House after eight years in office, Trump will immediately be confronted with the challenge of governing, as he attempts to apply his CEO experience to running the nation.  His team has vowed a \u201crobust\u201d start to the Trump administration, which could include everything from rescinding controversial Obama actions to renegotiating trade deals to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. An immediate task for the new administration will be to get Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees confirmed.  His advisers have complained that Democrats are slowing the process, and resisting the kind of swift confirmation the Senate gave many of Obama\u2019s nominees in 2009. Before he spoke on Friday, throngs of protesters were causing disruptions on the edges of the security zone in Washington.  Some blocked checkpoints and forced their temporary closure earlier Friday morning, while elsewhere demonstrators resorted to violence and vandalism.  They clashed with police later in the afternoon, amid dozens of arrests. While dozens of House Democrats boycotted Friday\u2019s ceremonies \u2013 a move that fueled disputes with Trump\u2019s team over the weekend \u2013 other prominent Democrats and past presidents of both parties were in attendance for the transfer of power.  Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, whose loss to Trump marked one of the biggest upsets in modern political history, attended and tweeted shortly before Trump took the oath that she came to \u201chonor our democracy & its enduring values.\u201d \u201cI will never stop believing in our country & its future,\u201d she wrote. Donald and Melania Trump met with the Obamas earlier Friday morning after attending a church service in Washington.

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump agreed on Friday to reopen the federal government for three weeks while negotiations continued over how to secure the nation\u2019s southwestern border, backing down after a monthlong standoff failed to force Democrats to give him billions of dollars for his long-promised wall. The president\u2019s concession paved the way for the House and the Senate to both pass a stopgap spending bill by voice vote. Mr. Trump signed it on Friday night, restoring normal operations at a series of federal agencies until Feb. 15 and opening the way to paying the 800,000 federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay for 35 days. The plan includes none of the money for the wall that Mr. Trump had demanded and was essentially the same approach that he rejected at the end of December and that Democrats have advocated since, meaning he won nothing concrete during the impasse. Mr. Trump presented the agreement with congressional leaders as a victory anyway, and indicated in a speech in the Rose Garden that his cease-fire may only be temporary: If Republicans and Democrats cannot reach agreement on wall money by the February deadline, he said that he was ready to renew the confrontation or declare a national emergency to bypass Congress altogether. \u201cWe really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on Feb. 15, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and Constitution of the United States to address this emergency.\u201d But Mr. Trump has already adopted some of the language that his Democratic adversaries have used during the longest shutdown in history. He conceded that \u201cwe do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea \u2014 we never did\u201d and invoked the utility of \u201csmart walls\u201d that substitute some physical barriers for drones and other sensors. The semantic evolution provides both the president and Democrats with a face-saving way forward if they want it. The surprise announcement was a remarkable surrender for a president who made the wall his nonnegotiable condition for reopening the government and a centerpiece of his political platform. Some immigration hard-liners that make up a key part of his political base were incensed by the capitulation. \u201cGood news for George Herbert Walker Bush: As of today, he is no longer the biggest wimp ever to serve as President of the United States,\u201d the commentator Ann Coulter, who has aggressively pushed Mr. Trump to keep his campaign promise on the wall, wrote on Twitter. On Capitol Hill, though, jittery lawmakers from both parties greeted the news with relief. Mr. Trump relented as the effects of the shutdown were rippling with ever greater force across the economy, with fallout far beyond paychecks. On Friday, air traffic controllers calling in sick slowed air traffic across the Northeast; hundreds of workers at the Internal Revenue Service also did not show up; and the F.B.I. director said he was as angry as he had ever been over his agents not being paid. \u201cNone of us are willing to go through this again,\u201d said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, referring to a half-dozen Republicans who voted on Thursday for a Democratic measure to reopen the government for two weeks. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just a few of us. There are a great many in our conference that feel pretty strongly.\u201d Democrats, who declined to revel in their clear victory, said they would work in good faith to strike a deal on border security. They have raised their offer on border security funding considerably and toughened their rhetoric on stopping illegal immigration. But Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated plainly that any compromise would not include money for a new border wall, which Democrats view as ineffective and overly costly even though many have supported border fencing in the past. \u201cHave I not been clear on a wall?\u201d Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. The two have repeatedly said they would support allocating additional money for technology and increased patrols along the border, like the ones Mr. Trump referenced on Friday. The cease-fire should pave the way for Mr. Trump to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress after all, but Ms. Pelosi said it would not be held this Tuesday, as originally scheduled. She had rescinded her invitation this week to come to the House chamber until the government was reopened, and on Friday, she said she would work with Mr. Trump to find a new date. \u201cThe State of the Union is not planned now,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cWhen government is open we will discuss a mutually agreeable date.\u201d As he announced the deal, Mr. Trump paid tribute to the federal workers who have endured five weeks without pay, expressing sympathy for them in a way he had not until now. \u201cYou are fantastic people,\u201d he said. He promised to ensure that workers would be compensated for the paychecks they have missed since the shutdown began in late December \u201cvery quickly or as soon as possible.\u201d To that effect, the Office of Management and Budget circulated a letter to affected agencies and departments on Friday afternoon instructing management to prepare for an \u201corderly reopening\u201d and to prioritize pay and benefits for workers. But other costs will be more permanent. Many federal contractors do not expect to be repaid for their work during the shutdown. Its compounding effects will ultimately cost the federal government more money than if it was open. And though the long-term economic damage caused by the shutdown remains to be seen, it appears that at the very least the short-term pain was more costly than a down payment on the border wall. According to an analysis from Standard & Poor\u2019s, the ratings agency, the United States economy lost at least $6 billion in the five weeks the government was partly shuttered \u2014 more than the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump had requested to build a steel or concrete barrier at the border. Mr. Trump offered no explanation for his surrender, nor did he acknowledge that it was one. On Twitter on Friday night, he said: \u201cThis was in no way a concession. It was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the Shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days, if no deal is done, it\u2019s off to the races!\u201d During the president\u2019s speech earlier in the day, cabinet officials and White House aides lined the sides of the Rose Garden and applauded him. Mr. Trump began his remarks as if he had actually emerged victorious, saying that he was \u201cvery proud to announce\u201d what he called \u201ca deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government.\u201d Few lawmakers even in the president\u2019s own party saw it that way. \u201cI hail from a state that is very supportive of the president and border security with barriers, so that is a consideration for me, but there are a lot of other strategies we could employ that would work better\u201d than a shutdown, said Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia. With polls showing the president enduring most of the blame by the public, Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, pressured Mr. Trump to agree to the temporary truce. Over the next three weeks, a House-Senate conference committee representing both parties will negotiate a border security plan, but if it fails to reach a consensus, government agencies could close again. The president\u2019s concession came a day after two competing measures to reopen the government failed on the Senate floor. A Democratic bill, which would have reopened the government with no strings attached, received more votes than the bill backed by Mr. Trump, which included temporary protections for some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion for his proposed border wall. Mr. McConnell and Mr. Schumer huddled on Thursday night after the failed votes to discuss a path forward. Mr. Schumer rejected the idea of offering a down payment for the wall to reopen the government and pitched Mr. McConnell on what ultimately became the agreement with Mr. Trump, according to a senior Democratic aide. Mr. McConnell, who viewed the shutdown as unnecessary from the start, found Mr. Trump eager to end the impasse, and in a series of calls, they ironed out the details. To the Republican leader, it was a way to ease much of the pressure on federal workers and get the Senate back to work. As late as early Friday morning, Mr. Trump appeared intent on declaring a national emergency at the border alongside the agreement to reopen the government, but Mr. McConnell and White House officials encouraged him to drop the idea, according to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to discuss them. Republican leaders tried to rally their members during a closed policy luncheon before Thursday\u2019s votes. But even as Republicans prepared to support Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, the signs of mounting frustration after weeks of inaction were evident. Republican senators rose one by one to voice concerns about the effect on federal workers and the lack of forward momentum in an impasse that felt unbearable. They swore they would never stand by another government shutdown. \u201cWe\u2019ve already lost,\u201d lamented Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, according to people familiar with the remarks. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of the extent we want to keep losing.\u201d At another point, during an exchange first reported by The Washington Post, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, vented at Mr. McConnell for putting Republicans in the position of having to vote on two competing approaches to reopen the government \u2014 one Republican and one Democratic \u2014 without consulting them first. \u201cYou put us in this position,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, according to one of his aides. Mr. McConnell, who had largely been absent from negotiations to reopen the government until late last week, responded, \u201cAre you suggesting I\u2019m enjoying this?\u201d",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2015 President Donald Trump is \u201cvery close\u201d to selecting an interim candidate to replace former FBI Director James Comey, he told White House reporters on Thursday. Trump confirmed that former Sen. Joe Lieberman is his top choice, according to White House pool reports. The founder of Lieberman\u2019s law firm \u2015 Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman \u2015 is one of the president\u2019s top lawyers. Trump met on Wednesday with Lieberman and three other candidates: current acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe; Frank Keating, the former governor of Oklahoma who previously served as an FBI agent and in high-level positions in the Justice Department; and Richard McFeely, who served in the FBI for 24 years before retiring as executive assistant director in 2014. Lieberman, who was the 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee before losing a primary bid for re-election and becoming an independent, would be an unconventional choice. He has no federal law enforcement experience and, while currently at a high-profile law firm, is most associated as a centrist Democrat. He has previously said that he would support an independent commission to investigate ties between Trump\u2019s administration and Russia. But it is his background in politics that had Democrats reacting with severe reservation. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) called it a \u201cmistake\u201d to select an elected official to the post, saying that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official. While Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), in an interview with Huffpost, called the possible nomination \u201cshocking.\u201d \u201cThere is no reason to appoint a politician to run the FBI,\u201d Schatz said. \u201cIt is contrary to everything the FBI is about and it undermines the confidence that the public needs to have in the independence of the agency. And more to the point, it is not as if there is no one else qualified to do this job. There are literally dozens of people who would get a unanimous vote.\u201d It is rare for an FBI director to be appointed without the full backing of the Senate, Schatz noted. And he speculated that a Lieberman nomination would split the chamber. A top Senate Democratic aide, likewise, put the prospects of immense opposition to the pick bluntly in an email to HuffPost: \u201cThere couldn\u2019t possibly be worse time to take the unprecedented step of handing the FBI over to a politician. That absolutely includes Senator Lieberman.\u201d During a Thursday Democratic caucus lunch, Sens. Dick Durbin (Ill.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) trashed the idea of Lieberman, or any politician, being in charge of the FBI, according to a senior Democratic aide who was in the private meeting. A majority of Democrats in the room said they agreed that he\u2019s a terrible choice. Not a one defended Lieberman. \u201cThe FBI director should be drawn from the ranks of career law enforcement\u200e, prosecutors or the FBI itself \u2015 not politicians,\u201d Durbin told HuffPost later. Republicans, by contrast, praised Lieberman. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) expressed \u201cgreat admiration\u201d for the former senator, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) speculated that Lieberman could get 100 confirmation votes, and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), said he would be \u201coverjoyed\u201d if Lieberman, who is a friend of his, were picked. \u201cJoe Lieberman has more experience than all of my Democrat colleagues combined, so screw them,\u201d McCain said of Democrats\u2019 concerns. The need for a new FBI director came after Trump fired Comey last week, a stunning move that occurred amid the FBI\u2019s ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. A series of explosive reports over the last week have heightened the appearance that Trump interfered with the investigation. In particular, The New York Times reported that Trump asked Comey to shut down a separate probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s contacts with Russian officials, according to a memo Comey wrote to document a meeting with Trump.",

Now it has become a symbol of whether you stand for or against same-sex marriage, or \u2013 alternately \u2013 the right to express your personal views without fear of retaliation. At Chick-fil-A locations across the country, people voted with their wallets today, coming out to express support for the fast-food chain after CEO Dan Cathy said in an interview that he is a firm backer of traditional marriage. \u201cI believe what the Bible says (about marriage),\u201d Chauncy Fields told us after wolfing down a breakfast of chicken and biscuits. \u201cSo I came out here to support Chick-fil-A and the movement.\u201d Chris Johnson sees a double standard. \u201cHe (Dan Cathy) said the exact same thing that President Obama said,\u201d Johnson told Fox News -- referring to the president\u2019s past opposition to gay marriage \u2013 \u201cAnd he gets negativity, and Obama gets positivity.\u201d At one Atlanta location, the restaurant was packed, while the line for the drive-thru looped twice around the building and out into the street. The backlash across the country against Chick-fil-A has been ferocious. After the mayors of Chicago and Boston heaped scorn upon the company, the mayor of Washington, DC, suggested it was peddling \u201chate chicken.\u201d Those comments drew a sharp response from Rev. William Owens of the Coalition of African American Pastors. \u201cSome people are saying that because of the position that Chick-fil-A is taking, they don\u2019t want them in their cities. It is a disgrace. It is the same thing that happened when I was marching for civil rights, when they didn\u2019t want a black to come into their restaurant,\" he told a press conference in Washington, DC. The Chick-fil-A firestorm has taken on different meanings for different people. For some, it harks to the days of intolerance and segregation. For others, it is about religious views of marriage. But for most people who Fox News spoke to today, it is about free speech. \u201cI think it comes down to a First Amendment issue. I mean, I do believe in the traditional values of marriage between a man and a woman,\u201d youth pastor Stephen Lenahan told Fox News after a leisurely breakfast with three members of his ministry. He is also puzzled as to why Dan Cathy is such a target, when other corporate CEOs who openly support same-sex marriage are not similarly criticized by conservatives. Lenahan says he sees a bigger issue at work here. \u201cThere is kind of a culture war going on and people aren\u2019t really respecting each other and difference of opinion. There\u2019s no dialogue taking place to get to the heart of what we really believe as a nation and what is truth.\u201d Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day \u2013 as it is being called was the idea of former Arkansas governor and Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee. But as protests against Chick-fil-A swelled across the country, dozens of groups and prominent individuals joined in support of the company. Among the groups is Project 21, a black conservative activist organization. One of its members, Demetrios Minor, said critics of Dan Cathy have taken his statements completely out of context. \u201cI think liberals are missing a vital point in their blind hatred of Chick-fil-A,\u201d Minor said in a statement sent to Fox News. \u201cBeing against gay marriage is not being anti-gay.\u201d Crtitics of Chick-fil-A argue that the company\u2019s opposition to gay marriage goes well beyond Dan Cathy\u2019s statements. Over the years, its philanthropic wing, WinShape, has donated millions of dollars to outside organizations that actively lobby against efforts to legalize same-sex marriage. On Friday, supporters of same-sex marriage will have their say. They plan a \u201ckiss-in\u201d at Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country \u2013 encouraging gays and lesbians to share a public display of affection at the home of the chicken sandwich.",

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, traveling with the president on his trip to Asia, told reporters that Trump \u201cbelieves that we cannot allow a mere allegation \u2015 in this case, one from many years ago \u2015 to destroy a person\u2019s life\u201d but that if the allegations are true, \u201cJudge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.\u201d A spokesperson for Vice President Mike Pence said the veep \u201cfound the allegations in the story disturbing and believes, if true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office.\u201d Moore\u2019s campaign denied the allegations, which The Washington Post first reported, telling the paper the accusations of four women are \u201cthe very definition of fake news.\u201d The Post reporters talked to more than 30 sources in the course of their investigation. On Thursday, numerous Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill called on Moore to drop out of the race \u2015 if the allegations are true. During his 2016 campaign, Trump dismissed allegations of sexual misconduct against himself from more than a dozen women and threatened to sue some of his accusers. He claimed that a 2005 tape of him bragging about sexual assault, which was released last fall, was \u201clocker room talk.\u201d In September, Moore, a controversial judge in Alabama, won the primary for the special election. He beat GOP establishment candidate Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who was chosen to fill the seat left vacant when Jeff Sessions became Trump\u2019s attorney general. Trump notably backed Strange over Moore, though many members of his base, including former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, supported Moore. But after Moore won, Trump disavowed his endorsement of Strange, deleting tweets in support of him. And the day after the primary, the president tweeted in support of Moore, calling him \u201ca really great guy.\u201d",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2015 In a stinging blow to President Barack Obama, the Senate voted Wednesday to override his veto of a bill to let 9/11 victims sue Saudi Arabia for its alleged role in the terrorist attacks. It\u2019s the first time a chamber of Congress has had the votes to overrule Obama on a veto. It\u2019s also the result of some unusual alliances: Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), who is on track to become the next Democratic leader, led the effort against the president alongside Sen. John Cornyn (Texas), a conservative member of Republican leadership. \u201cThis is pretty much close to a miraculous occurrence,\u201d Cornyn said before the vote. \u201cAll of us have come together and agreed this is the appropriate and right thing to do.\u201d It takes two-thirds of the Senate to override a veto. Party leaders got well above that level. The final tally was 97-1. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was the lone opposition. Two senators didn\u2019t vote at all: Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who is Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate, and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who was Clinton\u2019s runner-up in the presidential race. A Kaine spokesman later told HuffPost that the senator was traveling during the vote, but had he been there, he would have voted to sustain the veto. That puts him on the same page as Clinton, who has said she backs the bill. The House voted later on Wednesday to override the veto, causing the bill to become law. The bill, known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, prevents Saudi Arabia and other countries with alleged ties to terrorist groups from invoking their legal immunity in U.S. courts. It overrides the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which grants immunity to countries that aren\u2019t designated state sponsors of terrorism. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi citizens, but the Saudi government denies any role in the attacks and multiple U.S. government investigations have cleared it of blame. \u201cI deeply respect the president and the reasons he has given for vetoing the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said ahead of the vote. \u201cBut I urge my colleagues to move swiftly and soundly to reverse this veto so that these families can have their day in court.\u201d The White House has fought against the bill for months, to no avail. Administration officials warn that it would put Americans overseas at legal risk and leave the United States vulnerable to bogus lawsuits \u2015 and hefty bills \u2015 in court systems around the world. The European Union and former top executive branch officials have urged Obama to stop it, in the name of protecting sovereign immunity. Saudi Arabia has threatened to retaliate by selling off hundreds of billions of dollars in American assets. But those arguments didn\u2019t sway lawmakers, who say the White House\u2019s case is overblown. The bill originally passed the House and Senate without a single \u201cno\u201d vote. \u201cThe bill is near and dear to my heart as a New Yorker because it would allow the victims of 9/11 to pursue some small measure of justice,\u201d Schumer said Wednesday. \u201cCourts in New York have dismissed their claims against foreign entities alleged to have helped in the 9/11 attacks. They are following an incorrect reading of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.\u201d Obama vetoed the bill last week and issued a lengthy statement with it. In sum, he said he sympathizes with 9/11 victims and has expanded efforts to help them, but that JASTA undermines \u201ccore U.S. interests.\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest last week downplayed the significance of Obama getting such a strong rebuke from Congress, including from Democratic leaders. \u201cThe president is not particularly concerned about that,\u201d Earnest said in his Friday briefing. \u201cThis president has gone longer in his tenure in the White House than just about any other president in modern history before facing the prospect of having his veto overridden.\u201d",

        "body": " NEW YORK -- U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) set forth a foreign policy vision Wednesday that invoked President John F. Kennedy in an assertive call to project American power abroad. In comments delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, the conservative senator vying for the GOP presidential nomination said the world would be safer if the U.S. military had a bigger budget and America asserted itself more aggressively across the globe. While the threats facing the United States have changed in the 21st century, America's global influence remains a benevolent force, Rubio said. \"President Kennedy, like most presidents before and since, understood what I believe our current president does not: that American strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd that weakness, on the other hand, is the friend of danger and the enemy of peace.\" \"Sadly, I believe President Obama often disagrees with that simple truth,\" Rubio added. \"He entered office believing America was too hard on our adversaries, too engaged in too many places, and that if we just took a step back and did some more 'nation building at home' -- ceding leadership to other countries -- America would be better liked and the world better off.\" In laying out what his campaign calls the \"Rubio Doctrine,\" the presidential hopeful said he was guided by three principles: \"American strength,\" \"the protection of the American economy in a globalized world\" and \"moral clarity regarding America\u2019s core values.\" From his seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio has already played a key role in U.S. foreign policy debates, often staking out positions that directly counter President Barack Obama's administration. The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has challenged Obama's efforts to normalize diplomatic relations with the island, saying that closer ties would only help the communist Castro government keep power. Rubio has also opposed the Obama administration\u2019s negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, pressed for more support of rebels in Syria and advocated to increase aid to the government of Ukraine to counter Russia's influence in the east of the country. In Wednesday's speech the senator also took a swipe at Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, calling her tenure as secretary of state \"ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst.\" Journalist Charlie Rose asked Rubio after the speech whether invoking Kennedy and the Cold War might make him appear backward-looking at a time that Rubio's campaign portrays other U.S. leaders as \u201ctrapped in the past.\" Rubio responded that the Kennedy statements represented \"timeless\" truths. Rubio also told Rose he would not have authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein's regine if he knew Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction. \u201cNot only would I have not been in favor of it, but President [George W.] Bush wouldn\u2019t have been in favor of it,\u201d Rubio said. Bush\u2019s brother Jeb, who has all but formally announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, raised eyebrows Monday after telling Fox News he supported the invasion even now that he knows Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction. Jeb Bush later said he had misunderstood the question.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON - Representative Paul D. Ryan\u2019s budget blueprint assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama\u2019s health care law, even though Mitt Romney and Mr. Ryan have said those cuts would be devastating to millions of older Americans on Medicare As the partisan brawl over Medicare continued on Tuesday and threatened to become the focus of the race, the Obama campaign said that Mr. Ryan\u2019s budget plan \u2014 broadly endorsed by Mr. Romney \u2014 \u201cwould end Medicare as we know it\u201d and shift costs to beneficiaries. The Republicans hit back on Tuesday with a television commercial asserting that the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan was better for older Americans. \u201cYou paid into Medicare for years, every paycheck,\u201d the advertisement says. \u201cNow when you need it, Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare. Why? To pay for Obamacare. So now the money you paid for your guaranteed health care is going to a massive new government program that\u2019s not for you.\u201d Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, said, \u201cMitt Romney\u2019s Medicare ad is dishonest and hypocritical.\u201d The savings, she said, \u201cdo not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit.\u201d In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Mr. Ryan said he welcomed the back and forth. \u201cThis is a debate we want to have,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who are offering a plan to save Medicare, to protect Medicare, to strengthen Medicare.\u201d With 50 million beneficiaries, Medicare is a major concern for both parties. The current fight centers on changes in the program made in the new health law, the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 without Republican votes. Mr. Obama would use the savings to help offset the cost of covering the uninsured, as well as to improve the financial condition of the Medicare trust fund. Mr. Ryan says he would use the money to shore up Medicare and to help reduce budget deficits. Republicans won control of the House in 2010 partly by arguing that Democrats had raided Medicare to pay for Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law. Democrats hope to deflect such attacks this year by pointing out that Mr. Ryan\u2019s budget plan, approved twice by the House, includes similar savings \u2014 roughly $700 billion from 2013 to 2022, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Those savings have a complicated history. Mr. Ryan\u2019s budget plan was approved in March by the House Budget Committee, of which he is chairman. Before the vote, committee members discussed the budget plan and the Medicare provisions in detail. Representative Allyson Y. Schwartz, Democrat of Pennsylvania, asked whether the savings in the Affordable Care Act \u2014 \u201csometimes referred to as cuts to Medicare\u201d \u2014 were part of Mr. Ryan\u2019s budget. Austin Smythe, the panel\u2019s Republican staff director, said: \u201cWe assume those savings. We devote them to solvency of Medicare and to deficit reduction, instead of covering the expansions.\u201d At another point, Mr. Smythe said, \u201cWe assume the repeal of all of the expansions in the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Those expansions, he said, include subsidies to help low- and middle-income people buy private insurance. Democrats said that repeal of the new law would also wipe out new Medicare benefits, like additional coverage of prescription drugs and preventive services. The House approved the Ryan budget plan on March 29 by a vote of 228 to 191, with all but 10 Republicans voting for it. Mr. Romney has offered a Medicare proposal similar to Mr. Ryan\u2019s. But the Romney campaign said Tuesday that Mr. Romney would restore the money being squeezed out of Medicare by the 2010 health law. \u201cMitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obama\u2019s $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,\u201d said Lanhee Chen, the policy director for the Romney campaign. \u201cA Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare.\u201d The Ryan plan, like any budget resolution, specifies levels of spending, savings and revenues, based on certain policy assumptions. But, as Mr. Smythe pointed out, \u201cthe committees of jurisdiction determine the details\u201d in separate legislation. Mr. Ryan and Mr. Obama would impose similar overall constraints on Medicare spending, stipulating that average spending per beneficiary should not grow faster than the economy, measured by the per capita output of goods and services, plus one-half of one percentage point. However, they would achieve the goal in different ways. Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney would limit the government\u2019s current open-ended financial commitment to Medicare. The government would contribute a fixed amount of money on behalf of each beneficiary, and future beneficiaries could use the money to buy private insurance or to help pay for coverage under the traditional Medicare program. The new health care law, by contrast, will reduce projected Medicare payments to health maintenance organizations, hospitals and many other health care providers. As a backstop, to ensure savings, the law creates a Medicare cost control board. Cuts recommended by the board would take effect automatically unless Congress voted to block or change them. Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan would abolish the panel, which they describe as a tool for rationing health care.",

Cesar Sayoc, 56, of South Florida was taken into custody on Friday, FBI Director Chris Wray confirmed at a press conference. Sayoc has been charged with five federal crimes \u2015 interstate transportation of an explosive, illegal mailing of explosives, making threats against former presidents and certain other persons, threatening interstate communications, and assaulting current and former federal officers \u2015 the Department of Justice said. He faces up to 48 years in prison. In remarks at the White House before a youth leadership summit, Trump congratulated local and national law enforcement agencies for apprehending the suspect. The president pledged to prosecute those responsible \u2015 \u201cthem, him, her, whoever it may be,\u201d he said \u2015 to the fullest extent of the law. \u201cWe must never allow political violence to take root in America,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe bottom line is that Americans must unify,\u201d he went on. His comments echoed those he has delivered at rallies and sent over Twitter in the wake of the bomb scares, calling for unity and a calmer discourse but refusing to tone down his own inflammatory rhetoric. Minutes after addressing the threats to prominent Democrats, Trump claimed Republicans are often attacked for supporting him. \u201cCome to think of it, does anyone get attacked more than me?\u201d Trump said. The development came hours after two additional packages were discovered, one addressed to Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and the other to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. A suspicious package was also found Friday in Burlingame, California, addressed to Democratic donor Tom Steyer, CNN and NBC reported. A law enforcement source told CNN the package was similar to the other ones sent to politicians and public figures this week. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful that everyone we work with at NextGen America and Need to Impeach is safe,\u201d Steyer said in a statement Friday, referring to his super PAC NextGen and his campaign to impeach Trump. \u201cWe are seeing a systematic attack on our democracy and our rule of law that extends much further than just one isolated terrorist in Florida. Whether it\u2019s voter suppression, voter intimidation, attacks on our free press, gerrymandering, or attempted violence \u2015 the trust and norms that are the actual basis for our civil society and political system are being eroded.\u201d Authorities have heightened their search in Florida, as several of the packages may have passed through the state. The FBI said Friday that the package for Booker was found in a Florida mail facility. Throughout the week, more than 10 packages containing potential explosive devices have been mailed to lawmakers and other public figures critical of Trump, including former President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton, Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential opponent Hillary Clinton, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), actor Robert De Niro and former CIA Director John Brennan. The package addressed Brennan was sent to CNN\u2019s New York City bureau, sparking an evacuation Wednesday. Brennan is an MSNBC and NBC contributor. On Friday, postal officials intercepted the package for Clapper, a CNN contributor, before it could reach the CNN offices, where it was addressed, according to the network. The Sacramento County Sheriff Department also said Friday that a suspicious package found at a Sacramento mail facility and addressed to Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) contained an explosive device. FBI officials said they believed the package to be related to the others mailed out this week. All of the confirmed packages listed the Florida office of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, as the return address. Asked why Sayoc appeared to be targeting Democratic politicians and others critical of Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he didn\u2019t know but that the suspect \u201cappears to be a partisan\u201d Wray added: \u201cIt\u2019s too early at this stage to discuss motive.\u201d Investigators identified Sayoc based on a fingerprint found on the package sent to Waters and a DNA sample from a previous arrest in Florida, DOJ officials said Friday. When law enforcement arrested him on Friday in Plantation, Florida, they also took possession of a van covered in stickers supporting Trump and criticizing Democratic officials. Sayoc is a registered Republican and a self-described promoter and booking agent. He has a history of multiple arrests, including for felony grand theft and misdemeanor retail theft. A spokeswoman for Brevard College in North Carolina confirmed to HuffPost that Sayoc attended the school for three semesters starting in the fall of 1980 and did not graduate. Authorities were initially vague about the content of the packages, calling them simply \u201csuspected explosive devices.\u201d Wray elaborated at Friday\u2019s press briefing that each device contained roughly 6 inches of PVC pipe, as well as a small clock and wiring. \u201cThese are not hoax devices,\u201d he said. Wray noted that the investigation was ongoing and warned there could be other packages not yet intercepted.",

        "body": " Democrats urge Trump to cancel Putin summit, after indictment of Russian intel officers Top Democrats on Friday swiftly pressured President Trump to consider cancelling his upcoming summit with Vladimir Putin, after a dozen Russian intelligence officers were indicted for allegedly hacking party emails in 2016. Sen. Mark Warner, top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, offered Trump an ultimatum for the highly anticipated summit: make Russian interference a priority, or cancel the meeting. Other Democrats said Trump should nix the summit regardless -- though they were raising concerns about the meeting even before the indictment. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the charges during a Friday press conference. According to the DOJ document, 12 Russian intelligence officers are accused of hacking emails from the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic Party during the 2016 election. \u201cI want to make sure that other Americans hear ... the president make this issue of Russian interference a priority in the meeting,\u201d Warner, D-Va., told reporters on Capitol Hill Friday. \u201cIf they don\u2019t make the indictments a priority in the meeting in Helsinki, then the summit should be canceled.\u201d Warner, whose committee has been investigating Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 election for more than a year, also stressed that there \u201cneeds to be other Americans in the room\u201d in Helsinki, Finland Monday to ensure that Trump makes the issue of interference in the 2016 election a \u201cpriority.\u201d \u201cThere should be no one-on-one meeting between this president and Putin,\u201d Warner said. \u201cThere needs to be other Americans in the room, or the summit should be canceled.\u201d He warned, \u201cI\u2019m afraid the president could be taken advantage of.\u201d But as Trump continues to describe the Russia probe as a \"witch hunt,\" the White House downplayed the latest allegations. \u201cToday\u2019s charges include no allegations of knowing involvement by anyone on the campaign and no allegations that the alleged hacking affected the election result,\u201d said Lindsay Walters, the deputy White House press secretary. \u201cThis is consistent with what we have been saying all along.\u201d Within minutes of the indictment, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., urged Trump to call off the Putin meeting. \u201cCancel the Putin meeting. Now,\u201d Schumer tweeted Friday. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said a handshake with Putin would be \"a moment of historic cowardice.\" \"In light of what's been revealed about Russia\u2019s attack on our democracy, the president shaking Putin's hand would be a moment of historic cowardice. Call off this summit, @realDonaldTrump,\" Wyden tweeted. Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said Trump should \u201cimmediately cancel his meeting.\u201d House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said \u201cthe stakes\u201d for the summit \u201ccould not be higher.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump must demand and secure a real, concrete and comprehensive agreement that the Russians will cease their ongoing attacks on our democracy,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement Friday. \u201cFailure to stand up to Putin would constitute a profound betrayal of the Constitution and our democracy.\u201d Presuming the meeting takes place as scheduled, Helsinki will be the final stop on Trump\u2019s four-nation European tour. Trump spent the past week meeting with NATO allies in Brussels; meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May and Queen Elizabeth II in England; and visiting Scotland.",

        "body": " DANVILLE, Ky. \u2013- Joe Biden did everything President Barack Obama did not last week, and a good bit more. The vice president dominated the spotlight in the only debate between himself and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), charging at Republican Mitt Romney's running mate from the get-go and bombarding him with a flurry of eye rolls, interjections and accusations. What it accomplished among undecided voters, if anything, is hard to tell and will take days to sort out. Two instant surveys of Americans watching the debate -- one by CBS, one by CNN -- showed mixed results. But since vice presidential debates often have a negligible impact on the overall race anyway, Biden's sometimes over-the-top performance probably accomplished what he appeared intent on doing: rallying the Democratic base after Obama's woeful debate performance last week. Obama, at least, was cheered by the offensive. \"I'm going to make a special point of saying that I thought Joe Biden was terrific tonight,\" the president told reporters after stepping off Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, on his way back to the White House after a day of campaigning in Florida. Biden looked as if he could barely stay in his seat for much of the night, interrupting Ryan repeatedly and sometimes making it difficult for the GOP nominee to get out his answers. \u201cHe had his Red Bull. He certainly had his caffeine,\u201d Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said after the debate. It was a performance by the vice president guaranteed to amp up -\u2013 and buck up -\u2013 worried Democrats, who had fallen into a paralysis of anxiety after the president's debate. No one represented that Democratic angst more than blogger Andrew Sullivan, a supporter of the president. Obama adviser David Axelrod said \"Andrew is a unique thinker, and I can't speak for how he might react to this. I hope he is [reassured],\" Axelrod said, adding that he had \"high regard for [Sullivan] by the way.\" Sullivan, for the record, called the night \"a solid win for Biden\" and called Ryan \"competent.\" The Obama campaign team, in the spin room after the debate, focused on repeating the theme that, as Axelrod said, Biden showed \"passion\" and that he showed \"a great concern for the middle class.\" Passion was the thing Obama lacked last week, and Romney surprised the president and Democrats by talking constantly about how his policies would help the middle class. By contrast, Romney operatives in the spin room said Ryan clearly won on substance and composure while Biden devolved into fits of laughter and audible groans. \u201cI think the way the vice president handled himself was condescending,\u201d said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah). \u201cHe was constantly interrupting and trying to talk over people. When my 11-year-old tries to do that at the dinner table, it\u2019s not tolerated.\u201d Democrats were intent Thursday night to steal back any edge Romney might have deprived them of in being the party who can appeal to working class and blue-collar voters, and to any voter who considers themselves middle class, which is a large number. \"These guys discovered the phrase 'middle class' during the last six months on the campaign trail,\" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who has sparred with Ryan on the House Budget Committee for years and who played Ryan in debate preparation with Biden. Though it was Biden at the center of attention and who made it hard for Ryan to get in a word edgewise at times, the 42-year-old kept his composure for much of the night and got in some well-aimed shots at the vice president, who at 69 is his senior by 27 years. Ryan seemed focused more on winning over moderate and independent voters who are still making up their minds, less than a month before the election. The night's 90-minute debate, the only one for the two vice presidential candidates, fluctuated between domestic policy and foreign policy, with ABC's Martha Raddatz, a reporter with vast foreign policy experience, asking numerous questions about events overseas. But the number one goal for Biden all night was obvious from the outset: push back. Hard. It was the number one thing that Democrats had said Obama should have done last week, and it foreshadowed how the president will approach next Tuesday's debate with Romney, the second of three debates for the two men running for president. After Ryan finished his opening statement, responding to a question about the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya in a terrorist attack in Benghazi a month ago, Biden responded: \"That's a bunch of malarkey.\" \"Not a single thing he said is accurate,\" Biden said. At times, Biden repeatedly butted in on Ryan's answers, refusing to let Ryan finish his thought. If it were anyone other than Biden, who is treated by the press as a lovable, half-crazy uncle, he would have been labeled insufferable. Instead, he got the aggressive label. Republicans thought it was much more than that. Republican National Committee spokesman Tim Miller called Biden \u201cunhinged.\u201d Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom tweeted: \u201cRyan: serious, sober, steady. Biden: smirking, mocking, immature.\u201d Some of the more experienced Republicans tried to resist talking about Biden\u2019s behavior, knowing it would come across as complaining. \u201cMost people probably found the vice president\u2019s performance a little -- well anyway, I think that people will judge for themselves,\u201d said Ed Gillespie, one of the top advisers to Romney and one of the most seasoned Republican operatives in politics. But not even Gillespie, when he was asked by a reporter where he was going before he cut himself off, could resist getting some digs at Biden. \u201cI don't know if his staff didn't brief him or not, but somebody should have told him that these debates are split-screen,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cThere seemed to be some frustration on his part at times, and sometimes I got the impression that he couldn't defend the facts as they were, [so] raise your voice a little louder,\u201d Gillespie said. The Obama campaign, of course, relished in Republicans\u2019 focus on Biden\u2019s behavior instead of the substance of his remarks. \"Their side is all spending their time talking about laughing and facial tics,\" said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina. \"You're going to do that when you've lost a debate. And that's what happened tonight: they lost the debate.\" Of course, Biden was so demonstrative, so outsized, that it was hard to talk about anything else. Biden did another thing Obama did not a week ago. He raised the issue of Romney\u2019s comments at a fundraiser in May in which he talked disparagingly about people who receive government benefits, claiming that he could \u201cnever convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\" One of Ryan\u2019s best one-liners came when he sought to explain these comments. Ryan first told a humanizing story about Romney caring for a family whose children were in a car crash, a story clearly prepared to push back against the portrait of Romney as out of touch and uncaring. And he then added: \u201cWith respect to that quote, I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way.\u201d Although there were extended portions of the debate that focused on Libya, Syria, and Afghanistan, Biden and Ryan did engage in a lengthy back-and-forth in the middle of the debate on Medicare and tax policy. Ryan was, as usual, knowledgeable and in command of the facts. But Biden, as expected, attempted to plow him over with broadsides. \u201cStop talking about how you care about people. Show me something. Show me a policy,\u201d Biden said. Ryan smiled, and continued to work through a data-filled argument, mentioning the $831 billion stimulus, an 8 percent unemployment rate for 43 months, the 1.3 percent growth rate of the economy, the $90 billion for green energy programs in the stimulus, and the 12 million jobs he and Romney say their economic program would create. Biden didn\u2019t worry so much about numbers. Biden\u2019s argument on Medicare was aimed at voters\u2019 guts, much more so than minds. He acknowledged that Romney\u2019s Medicare plan would not cost seniors an extra $6,400 a year, despite the claim in a recently launched Obama campaign ad. The $6,400 figure is based on a study of one of Ryan\u2019s earlier plans for Medicare, which he has since changed to make it more bipartisan. Biden, aware of this, told voters they should be suspicious somebody \u201cwho would actually put in motion a plan that \u2026 added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?\u201d",

        "body": " The leaders of the Senate intelligence committee said Tuesday they had subpoenaed two of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's businesses as part of the ongoing probe into Russian activity during last year's presidential campaign. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the top Democrat on the committee, identified the businesses as Flynn Intel Group LLC and Flynn Intel Group Inc., both based in Alexandria, Va. The committee's action comes a day after Flynn\u2019s lawyer notified the committee that his client will invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and not comply with the committee\u2019s subpoena seeking documents related to its investigation. \"A business does not have the right to take the fifth,\" Warner told reporters. The investigation focuses on whether Flynn and other Trump associates colluded with Russia to boost the Republican candidate in the 2016 elections. Trump fired Flynn in February because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with Russia\u2019s ambassador about potentially easing economic sanctions. Flynn is also being investigated over whether he was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. Intelligence committee chairman Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said Tuesday that the panel also sent a letter to Flynn\u2019s lawyer questioning whether his client can indeed invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid turning over documents. Burr added that if there is no response from Flynn, the committee may consider pursuing a contempt of Congress charge. \"Everything is on the table,\" Burr said. Everything but immunity, he added.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Republican Congressional candidates on Monday intensified efforts to inject the divide over construction of an Islamic center near ground zero into the midterm campaigns while the Senate\u2019s top Democrat said he objected to the mosque being built there. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader and a Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight, said through a spokesman that those who plan to erect the Islamic center should look elsewhere. That separates Mr. Reid from President Obama\u2019s support of the developers\u2019 right to build the center. \u201cThe First Amendment protects freedom of religion,\u201d said Jim Manley, a top adviser to Mr. Reid. \u201cSenator Reid respects that but thinks that the mosque should be built someplace else.\u201d In a number of releases and statements, Republican House and Senate candidates challenged Democrats like Mr. Reid to make their positions clear on the construction of a mosque and community center about two blocks from the site of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in New York City. \u201cGround zero is hallowed ground to Americans,\u201d Elliott Maynard, a Republican trying to unseat Representative Nick J. Rahall II, a Democrat, in West Virginia\u2019s Third District, said in a typical statement. \u201cDo you think the Muslims would allow a Jewish temple or Christian church to be built in Mecca?\u201d Republicans said Mr. Obama\u2019s defense of the right of the developers to pursue the project showed that he was out of touch with average Americans. \u201cIt is very troubling to see President Obama again turning a deaf ear to the thoughts and concerns of a majority of Americans,\u201d said James Renacci, a Republican candidate in Ohio\u2019s 16th District, who said people at a recent public meeting were furious about the mosque proposal. The remarks were a rare instance in this campaign season when Republicans have strayed from a focus on economic issues in their push for substantial gains in the House and Senate in November. The intensity of their attacks showed that they do not appear worried about the risk of being seen as intolerant or not supportive of the right to freedom of religion. Some leading Democrats said it was the president\u2019s role to stand up for constitutional rights in the mosque dispute. Representative James E. Clyburn, the No. 3 House Democrat, said Monday that \u201carticulating the constitutional principles\u201d on which the country was founded and \u201ccalling for tolerance on the part of all of its people\u201d were part of \u201ca presidential act worth exercising.\u201d Privately, many Democrats were not pleased that the issue had been thrown into their laps during the summer recess as they believed they had been making inroads by talking about how some Republicans support privatizing Social Security. But strategists said Democrats could counter the Republican offensive by labeling the mosque dispute as a local issue and saying Democrats remain focused on the economy. Some also said the White House should not have put lawmakers on the spot in the first place and could have been better prepared for the president\u2019s statement, lining up religious and community leaders to offer support for the right to build the mosque and undermine Republican attacks. Other Democrats said they did not see the fight resonating strongly outside New York and did not expect it to become a defining campaign issue. Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat who represents the district that includes ground zero, said he doubted that the fight over the mosque would inflict much damage on fellow Democrats in the November elections. Mr. Nadler, whose view is that the developers were entitled to build the mosque at the selected location if they choose, said, \u201cUltimately I suspect that once this simmers down in a few weeks, people will realize that everybody\u2019s liberty is at stake here.\u201d The planned community center, perhaps 15 stories tall, would be built in three adjacent buildings two blocks north of ground zero, though one building, owned by Consolidated Edison, has yet to be sold. The other two are all but vacant now; worship services are already taking place in one of them. The developer, Sharif el-Gamal, a real estate investor born in New York, has said the center would include meeting rooms, a prayer space, a 500-seat auditorium and a pool. Two mosques, founded in 1970 and 1985, are already within several blocks of the proposed center. They are so busy and crowded that a search was begun for more space. Before Mr. Obama spoke out, leading Republican figures like Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House, and Sarah Palin, the party\u2019s 2008 vice-presidential nominee, had been voicing opposition to the Islamic center. That caused other Republicans to warn that the party risked a backlash and was alienating the nation\u2019s Muslims. But Mr. Gingrich showed no sign of backing down on Monday. \u201cNazis don\u2019t have the right to put up a sign next to the Holocaust Museum in Washington,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said on the Fox News program \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d \u201cWe would never accept the Japanese putting up a site next to Pearl Harbor. There\u2019s no reason for us to accept a mosque next to the World Trade Center.\u201d Democratic campaign officials accused Republicans of exploiting the Sept. 11 attacks, noting that their outrage over the Islamic center came just weeks after many House Republicans opposed a new medical program to monitor and treat emergency workers and others suffering ill effects from exposure to hazardous materials at ground zero.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced Thursday that when it comes to taxes, it will recognize same-sex couples' marriages even if they live in a state that does not. The decision, which was prompted by the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, marks the latest political progress for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Prior to this spring, the Internal Revenue Service did not recognize same-sex married couples pursuant to section 3 of DOMA. Once DOMA was overturned in June, the question became: What about same-sex married couples who moved to a state that didn\u2019t recognize their marriage (a couple married in Massachusetts who moved to Arkansas, for example)? Thursday\u2019s ruling by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew provides a uniform policy for the IRS; the state of celebration -- where the wedding took place -- now trumps the state of residency when it comes to federal tax status for same-sex married couples. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide. It provides access to benefits, responsibilities and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve,\u201d Lew said in a statement. \u201cThis ruling also assures legally married same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country knowing that their federal filing status will not change.\u201d The new policy, which was first shared by Lew in a conference call that included LGBT advocates, holds a bit of political significance. It was the burden of federal tax law on same-sex couples, after all, that prompted the legal challenge to DOMA in the first place. Edie Windsor, the plaintiff in the DOMA case, sued the government after being forced to pay estate taxes following the death of her wife, Thea Spyer. Had they been a heterosexual couple, Windsor's tax burden would have been zero. After DOMA was overturned, it was reported that the IRS owed Windsor $363,053. Under the new Treasury policy, all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor, including filing status, employee benefits, IRA contributions, earned income, child tax credits, and income, gift and estate taxes, will apply to same sex couples regardless of where they live. On the flip side, gay couples also will now be subjected to the so-called marriage penalty, in which some (usually upper-middle class) joint filers incur a higher tax burden than they would if they filed as single people. The policy only applies to married couples, and not those in domestic partnerships or same-sex unions. \u201cWith today\u2019s ruling, committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nation\u2019s federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home,\u201d said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin. \u201cThese families finally have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act.\u201d The Treasury\u2019s actions on Thursday are just the latest in a set of LGBT policies offered by agencies within the Obama administration following the DOMA ruling. The Federal Election Commission, and Departments of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, also extended federal benefits to gay couples in states that don\u2019t recognize their marriages. UPDATE: Commenting on the Treasury Department's new policy, Edie Windsor hailed the decision as the precise remedy that she sought when she challenged the constitutionality of DOMA.",

        "body": " Congress on Wednesday overwhelmingly rejected President Obama\u2019s veto of a bipartisan bill letting families of Sept. 11 victims sue the Saudi Arabian government, in the first successful veto override of Obama\u2019s presidency. Marking a significant defeat for the White House, the House ensured the bill will become law after voting 348-77 to override Wednesday afternoon. This followed a 97-1 vote hours earlier in the Senate. Despite last-ditch warnings from the Obama administration that the legislation could hurt national security and was \u201cbadly misguided,\u201d lawmakers dismissed the concerns. \"This bill is about respecting the voices and rights of American victims,\" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., speaking on the Senate floor moments before Wednesday's vote in that chamber, pushed back hard on Saudi government objections to the legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple. If the Saudis were culpable, they should be held accountable. If they had nothing to do with 9/11, they have nothing to fear,\u201d Schumer said. Lawmakers in both chambers needed to muster a two-thirds majority to override, and did so easily. The lone \"no\" vote in the Senate was Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. With elections just over a month away, many lawmakers were reluctant to oppose a measure backed by 9/11 families who say they are still seeking justice 15 years after the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. A group of senators pledged to find ways to improve the measure during a post-election, lame-duck session of Congress. Despite an expectation that Congress would override, the White House made a last-ditch attempt to fight it. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Reid, Obama warned the bill could cause chaos in U.S. foreign affairs, as other countries would use the measure to justify the creation of ways to target \"U.S. policies and activities that they oppose.\" \"As a result, our nation and its armed forces, State Department, intelligence officials and others may find themselves subject to lawsuits in foreign courts.\" Obama wrote in a letter delivered Tuesday. But Cornyn, one of the bill's leading proponents, dismissed Obama's concerns as \"unpersuasive.\" Cornyn, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, and other supporters said the bill is narrowly tailored and applies only to acts of terrorism that occur on U.S. soil. The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, moved to the floor of the Senate in May and passed by voice vote. The bill cleared the House earlier this month, also by voice vote. Defense Secretary Ash Carter, in a letter Monday to a senior member of Congress, said he's sympathetic to the intent of the measure. But the legislation could lead to the public disclosure of American secrets and even undercut counterterrorism efforts by sowing mistrust among U.S. partners and allies, according to Carter. With the override, the bill will now become law. During his nearly two full terms in office, Obama had never had a veto overridden by Congress. The legislation gives victims' families the right to sue in U.S. court for any role that elements of the Saudi government may have played in the 2001 attacks. Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudi nationals. Courts would be permitted to waive a claim of foreign sovereign immunity when an act of terrorism occurs inside U.S. borders, according to the terms of the bill. Saudi Arabia has objected vehemently to the legislation. Obama vetoed the measure last week, telling lawmakers the bill would make the U.S. vulnerable to retaliatory litigation in foreign courts that could put U.S. troops in legal jeopardy. But the bill's proponents have disputed Obama's rationale as \"unconvincing and unsupportable,\" saying the measure is narrowly tailored and applies only to acts of terrorism that occur on U.S. soil. Kristen Breitweiser, a 9/11 widow and co-chair of September 11th Advocates, criticized Carter's assessment, saying that the defense secretary had testified before Congress last week that he wasn't an expert on the bill.",

        "body": " NRA School Safety Report Recommends Arming Teachers, Loosening Gun Laws WASHINGTON -- Former Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) on Tuesday released a 225-page report on school safety funded by the National Rifle Association. The report, commissioned in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, recommended properly trained armed employees to provide \"an important layer of security in schools.\" The report was prepared by a 12-person task force, called the School Shield Program, led by Hutchinson. At Tuesday's press conference, he stated that its findings were independent of the nation's largest gun lobby. \"Teachers should teach, but if there is personnel that has interest and is willing to go through 40 to 60 hours of [firearms] training, then schools should be willing to [arm them],\" Hutchinson said. He added that the report found that \"local school authorities are in the best position\" to determine their own school security measures, \"specifically whether an armed security guard is necessary and supported by the education and citizen community.\" The task force recommended that schools designate willing staff to be armed and trained, and it proposed a model training program, 40-60 hours per person, at what Hutchinson said would be a cost of about $800 to $1,000 per trained employee. Armed school personnel, called school resource officers, would also be required to undergo a \"background investigation, testing, and [have] relevant experience.\" The committee didn't recommend any specific kind of firearm for school security, Hutchinson said, adding, \"Everything from a sidearm, to a shotgun, to an AR-15\" would work. The task force also suggested that states loosen current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property. Many states currently prohibit anyone but a law enforcement officer from possessing guns in a school. Other recommendations included creating threat assessment teams at schools, better coordinating state and federal funding for school security, and offering an online assessment tool, so that administrators can evaluate their schools' potential security gaps. Hutchinson's report and his press conference were both met with scathing criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which supports broader gun control measures and strongly opposes arming educators. In a statement, union President Randi Weingarten called the report \"a cruel hoax that will fail to keep our children and schools safe,\" adding that the findings \"are simply designed to assist gun manufacturers flood the nation and our schools with more guns.\" The NRA also put out a statement on the report, over which the gun lobby insists it had no influence. The NRA said it needs \"time to digest\" the findings, but it commended Hutchinson and his team for contributions that \"will go a long way to making America's schools safer.\" The report marks the culmination of a controversial process that began in December, when NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre held a press conference the week after the shooting in Newtown, Conn. At the time, LaPierre assailed the media and gun control advocates for their responses to the massacre, and he proposed that armed volunteers protect schools and that gun-free school zones be eliminated. The speech was widely considered a public relations disaster. Hutchinson said Tuesday that the idea of armed volunteers was scrapped after it was met with \"great reluctance\" from school employees. But the recommendation that states allow non-law enforcement officers, such as teachers and principals, to carry guns in schools would essentially eliminate gun-free school zones. Asked about the current debate in Congress over gun control legislation, Hutchinson said he had \"not dealt with the separate debate\" because he had been too busy considering school safety issues. He did, however, weigh in on state gun control efforts currently being debated in Connecticut, which include a ban on high-capacity magazines and a broader assault weapons ban. Hutchinson called them \"totally inadequate.\" \"You can address assault weapons, but it doesn't stop violence in schools. So if you're going to protect children, you have to do something about enhancing school safety,\" he said. Hutchinson also encouraged the NRA to continue funding pilot programs to train school employees to carry weapons. When he had finished introducing the report, Hutchinson called up Mark Mattioli, whose 6-year-old son, James Mattioli, was killed in December along with 19 other children at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Mattioli praised the NRA \"for coming up and spending the time and resources on putting a program like this together.\"",

Trump said he wanted to make sure there's no \"conflict of interest\" in case he decides to run as a third-party candidate next year. He cast his decision as a way to keep his options open. He said later on Fox News that he's still considering an independent bid. \"I am looking at it, if the Republicans choose the wrong candidate, which is a possibility, and if the economy continues to be bad, which I think it will be,\" Trump said. The real estate mogul and reality TV star said he wants to make sure Republicans pick the \"right\" candidate -- he said he still plans to make an endorsement despite his threatened third-party run. Though the Dec. 27 debate technically is sponsored by Newsmax, Trump quickly became the face of it after he was named as moderator. While former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum agreed to attend early on, other Republican candidates subsequently bowed out. Some expressed concern that Trump, who previously flirted with a possible Republican presidential bid before shelving the idea, would not definitively rule out running as a third-party candidate. Trump on Tuesday specifically cited Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus' concerns about his involvement. He said he does not expect Newsmax to follow through with the debate now that he's out. \"We would have done very well. We would have gotten great ratings,\" Trump said, voicing his trademark confidence. Trump first announced his debate decision in a written statement Tuesday afternoon. \"It is very important to me that the right Republican candidate be chosen to defeat the failed and very destructive Obama administration, but if that Republican, in my opinion, is not the right candidate, I am not willing to give up my right to run as an independent candidate,\" he said. \"Therefore, so that there is no conflict of interest within the Republican Party, I have decided not to be the moderator of the Newsmax debate. ... I must leave all of my options open because, above all else, we must make America great again!\" Trump went on to praise Gingrich and Santorum for \"having the courage, conviction, and confidence\" to agree to the debate.",

        "body": " National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s upcoming Capitol Hill address will be a \u201cdestructive\u201d force in long-standing U.S.-Israel relations, adding more political acrimony to the already contentious visit. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John Boehner, the leader of the Republican-controlled chamber, without him first conferring with the White House or State Department. Such a move is generally considered a diplomatic no-no, but Boehner says he wanted to bring in Netanyahu to address the nuclear threat from Iran amid ongoing negotiations between Washington and Tehran. The visit, though, has further challenged the strained relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu. \"It's destructive to the fabric of the relationship,\" Rice said Tuesday on PBS\u2019s the \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d show. \u201cIt\u2019s always been bipartisan. We need to keep it that way.\" Rice's statements were among the Obama administration's toughest on Netanyahu's speech, set for March 3. To date, administration officials had maintained a more low-key stance, voicing concerns about the visit while saying Obama would not meet with his Israeli counterpart strictly out of a desire not to influence Israel's tight elections. But tensions are rising on all sides. Rice's comments came as Netanyahu turned down an invitation to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats during his trip to Washington, saying such a session could \"compound the misperception of partisanship\" surrounding his visit. Netanyahu told Sens. Dick Durbin, of Illinois, and Dianne Feinstein, of California, that he regrets the invitation has been perceived by some to be political or partisan. \"I can assure you that my sole intention in accepting it was to voice Israel's grave concerns about a potential nuclear agreement with Iran that could threaten the survival of my country,\" he told the senators in a letter. U.S. officials suggest Netanyahu\u2019s trip is aimed primarily at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, a signature Obama foreign policy objective. While Netanyahu has long been skeptical of the negotiations, his opposition has increased over what he sees as Obama's willingness to make concessions that would leave Iran on the brink of being able to build a nuclear weapon. U.S. and Iranian officials reported progress in negotiations this week on a deal that would clamp down on Tehran's nuclear activities for at least 10 years but then slowly ease restrictions. Israeli officials warned this week that such a deal would allow Iran to become a nuclear threshold state. Vice President Biden won't attend the Netanyahu speech. And more than a half-dozen House and Senate Democrats also have said they will skip the event, calling it an affront to Obama and the administration as they negotiate with Iran over its nuclear program. But Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called Biden\u2019s absence \u201cappalling and unacceptable.\u201d \"I don\u2019t know where Joe Biden will be or what he will be doing, but I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s more important than being in the chamber and listening to our best ally in the region -- Israel -- about the biggest threat to mankind, a nuclear-armed Iran. ... It shows complete disrespect, it shows they\u2019re more worried about the politics in Israel than receiving information about a common threat,\" Graham, R-S.C., said Tuesday night on Fox News' \"On the Record with Greta Van Susteren.\" Durbin said he regretted that Netanyahu could not meet with the Democrats. \"We offered the prime minister an opportunity to balance the politically divisive invitation from Speaker Boehner.\" Durbin said. \"His refusal to meet is disappointing to those of us who have stood by Israel for decades.\"",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election disputed on Friday a report that said President Trump had directed Michael D. Cohen, his longtime lawyer and fixer, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow. The rare public statement by a spokesman for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, challenged the facts of an article published by BuzzFeed News on Thursday saying that Mr. Cohen had told prosecutors about being pressured by the president before his congressional testimony. \u201cBuzzFeed\u2019s description of specific statements to the special counsel\u2019s office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u2019s congressional testimony are not accurate,\u201d said the spokesman, Peter Carr. Before Mr. Carr\u2019s statement, the BuzzFeed report led to a flurry of reactions by senior members of Congress who said that the allegations, if true, could be grounds for initiating impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump. The president himself responded on Twitter late Friday, calling the special counsel\u2019s statement \u201ca very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!\u201d A proven effort by Mr. Trump to pressure a witness to commit perjury would be one of the most damning revelations so far in the investigation into Russia\u2019s attempts to sabotage the 2016 presidential election and could be the cornerstone of a case that the president obstructed justice to keep investigators at bay. Both the White House and lawyers for Mr. Trump vigorously denied the BuzzFeed report even before the special counsel\u2019s office weighed in. \u201cTwo words sum it up better than anything anybody else can say, and that is \u2019categorically false,\u2019\u201d the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, told reporters on Friday. BuzzFeed News maintained that its report was accurate, its editor, Ben Smith, said after Mr. Mueller\u2019s office disputed the account. \u201cWe stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what he\u2019s disputing,\u201d Mr. Smith said on Twitter. The statement by Mr. Carr, the special counsel\u2019s spokesman, was unusual because it appeared to be the first time he had publicly challenged the facts of a news media account that had generated significant attention for its revelations about the president. The New York Times has not independently confirmed the BuzzFeed report. One person familiar with Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony to the special counsel\u2019s prosecutors said that Mr. Cohen did not state that the president had pressured him to lie to Congress. Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that his panel would investigate the BuzzFeed report and was \u201calready working to secure additional witness testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal and other investigative matters.\u201d If true, Mr. Schiff said, the allegations \u201cwould constitute both the subornation of perjury as well as obstruction of justice.\u201d Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, another Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote in a tweet that \u201cif the @BuzzFeed story is true, President Trump must resign or be impeached.\u201d Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Friday that the panel expected Mr. Cohen to be back to testify privately in early February. The report added another jolt to a chaotic week for the White House, which has had to fend off questions about recent revelations that F.B.I. counterintelligence agents began investigating Mr. Trump in 2017 and that Mr. Trump has tried to conceal the details from senior administration officials about his interactions with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. In a December court filing, prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller described how Mr. Cohen had repeatedly lied to Congress both about the length of negotiations over the Trump Tower Moscow deal and about Mr. Trump\u2019s involvement in the project. Mr. Cohen had told lawmakers that the negotiations ended in January 2016 \u2014 before the first presidential primaries \u2014 and were never discussed extensively among executives of the Trump Organization. In fact, according to prosecutors, the discussions continued as late as June 2016, after Mr. Trump was the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. They also said Mr. Cohen discussed the progress of the Moscow project with Mr. Trump more frequently than he had told the committee and had briefed members of Mr. Trump\u2019s family about the negotiations. When he appeared in court to plead guilty to lying to Congress, Mr. Cohen said he had concealed his interactions with Russian officials and the fact that he asked Mr. Trump to travel to Russia to promote the deal because he wanted to support Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cpolitical messaging.\u201d That day, Mr. Trump defended his role in the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, brushing aside concerns that he was advancing his business interests at the time he was hoping to become president. \u201cThere was a good chance that I wouldn\u2019t have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?\u201d he told reporters. Mr. Cohen drafted his statement to Congress in August 2017 along with Steven Ryan, his lawyer at the time, according to people familiar with how the testimony was put together. Mr. Ryan was working with lawyers for the Trump family as part of a joint defense agreement. At least one of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers saw Mr. Cohen\u2019s congressional testimony before he delivered it in August and October 2017, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Cohen initially repeated his false statements about the Moscow tower to prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller after he pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations and financial crimes. But he corrected himself during subsequent interviews and proved credible, the special counsel\u2019s office said in a December sentencing memo. Mr. Cohen said he initially lied because he did not want to contradict his congressional testimony, prosecutors said. Subsequently, he took care \u201cnot to overstate his knowledge or the role of others in the conduct under investigation\u201d and provided \u201cuseful information\u201d about his contacts with \u201cpersons connected to the White House\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the special counsel\u2019s filing said. That truthfulness was a departure from Mr. Cohen\u2019s pattern of deception throughout his professional life, according to a separate sentencing memo by federal prosecutors in New York, filed at the same time as Mr. Mueller\u2019s. Driven by greed, they said, he \u201crepeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends.\u201d Mr. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and financial crimes. He said he took full responsibility for his crimes, but said he acted out of blind loyalty to Mr. Trump, who he said \u201cled me to choose a path of darkness over light.\u201d During his nomination hearing this week to become attorney general, William P. Barr was asked if the president would have committed a crime if he had coached a witness to testify falsely \u2014 or not to testify at all. \u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cUnder an obstruction statute, yes.\u201d",

        "body": " President Trump announced Sunday that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, weeks earlier than planned and just days after Mattis' bombshell resignation letter made clear his policy disagreements with the White House. \"I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019,\" Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday morning.  \"Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, & previously Boeing.  He will be great!\" Shanahan is a former Boeing executive who joined the Pentagon in July 2017. In his resignation letter Thursday, Mattis, 68, had said he would remain in his role for more than three months.  Also on Thursday, Trump had said Mattis -- the first Cabinet official in 40 years to resign over a stated policy difference with the president -- was leaving in February. \"The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February,\" Mattis wrote Thursday. It was not immediately clear why Mattis' departure date was apparently moved up, but tension in the Defense Department and Washington generally has skyrocketed in the days since he suddenly announced his resignation. Sources told Fox News this week that Mattis had quit \"in protest\" over the president's national security policies and that more resignations could be coming.  (In 2013, then-President Obama removed Mattis from his post running U.S. military's Central Command, reportedly without calling to notify him of the decision.) U.S. officials said this week that the Trump administration is making plans to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria, and Trump later tweeted that \u201cwe have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.\u201d Trump has stood by his Syria decision despite fierce blowback, telling detractors that the pullout should come as \u201cno surprise\u201d given his 2016 campaign promises and arguing that America\u2019s role as \u201cPoliceman of the Middle East\u201d is not worth the sacrifice. Ground troops moved into Syria in 2015 to combat ISIS in the region, amid an escalating Syrian civil war.  Trump had talked about pulling out of Syria before, but military leaders had warned about ISIS re-emerging should the U.S. do so.  There is also concern about abandoning the U.S.' Kurdish allies. The news that Mattis will be leaving sooner than expected comes just days after Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat Islamic State (ISIS), on Saturday accelerated his planned departure and announced his resignation. The Associated Press reported that McGurk said in a resignation letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that ISIS was on the run, but wasn\u2019t yet defeated and that U.S. work in Syria wasn\u2019t yet done.  Fox News has confirmed that McGurk submitted his resignation letter on Friday, a day after Mattis resigned.  His resignation is effective December 31. The president downplayed the news via Twitter Saturday evening, saying he had neither met McGurk nor appointed him. \"Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015.  Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving,\" Trump tweeted.  \"Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!\" \"If anybody but your favorite President, Donald J. Trump, announced that, after decimating ISIS in Syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in America,\" he continued in a follow-up tweet.  \"With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!\" Meanwhile, the White House's plan to withdraw half its troops in Afghanistan by the summer -- some 7,000 soldiers -- has drawn similar criticism.  While President Obama repeatedly promised to pull all troops out of Afghanistan by 2014, U.S. and NATO forces remain there in a predominately training and advising role. Afghanistan's security forces rely heavily on U.S. airpower against both Taliban and an upstart Islamic State affiliate.  More than 2,400 American soldiers have died in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion, and Trump announced in a video last week that troop deaths were on his mind in announcing the pullouts.",

LePage hinted on Tuesday that he may resign before his term ends in 2018, telling a local radio station, \u201cI\u2019m looking at all options. I think some things I\u2019ve been asked to do are beyond my ability. I\u2019m not going to say that I\u2019m not going to finish it. I\u2019m not saying that I am going to finish it.\u201d He walked back his remarks later that day, criticizing \u201crumors\u201d that he was going to resign \u2015 even though they came directly from LePage himself. On Wednesday morning, LePage said unequivocally that he will be staying put. \u201cI will not resign,\u201d he said after a reconciliation meeting with Gattine, according to the Boston Globe. Democrats have been pounding LePage, saying that he needs to step down and questioning his mental abilities. Gattine said after their meeting he believes the governor should resign even though he apologized for the voicemail. \u201cEvery day, Paul LePage gives Maine people more evidence that he is unfit for office,\u201d State House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe (D) and Assistant House Majority Leader Sara Gideon (D) said in a statement Tuesday night. \u201cThe governor is not mentally able to serve and needs to resign.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not an alcoholic and I\u2019m not a drug addict and I don\u2019t have mental issues,\u201d LePage replied Wednesday. \u201cWhat I have is a backbone, and I want to move Maine forward.\u201d He said he will be seeking \u201cspiritual guidance\u201d from his family. Members of LePage\u2019s own party have been trying to deal with the headaches he\u2019s caused as well, with one GOP state senator even talking about censuring him. State House Minority Leader Ken Fredette (R) said Tuesday night that he would not support bringing the legislature back into a special session to consider sanctions against LePage \u2015 a position that his counterpart in the Senate wouldn\u2019t back. \u201cWith all due respect, I completely disagree with Fredette\u2019s position,\u201d Senate President Mike Thibodeau (R) said Wednesday. \u201cThe Republican Senate caucus has clearly stated that we need an acceptable plan for corrective action before the determination of whether the Legislature should convene is made.\u201d The latest controversy really dates back to January, when LePage claimed that drug dealers with names like \u201cSmoothie, D-Money and Shifty\u201d come into Maine and \u201cimpregnate a young, white girl before they leave.\u201d Last week, LePage tried to back up that statement \u2015 which had been widely criticized at the time \u2015 by saying he keeps a binder of drug dealers arrested in Maine and \u201c90-plus percent of those pictures\u201d in his book are of black and Hispanic individuals. LePage was upset because he mistakenly believed Gattine heard those remarks and called him a racist, and so he left him the voicemail. Gattine denied to the Portland Press Herald that he ever called the governor a racist. LePage has long been clear about his distaste for the media. He has said newspapers are his greatest fear and joked about blowing up the headquarters of the Portland Press Herald.",

        "body": " The AARP pushed back Friday on a report claiming the nation's most powerful seniors lobby was dropping its opposition to benefits cuts -- but at the same time acknowledged \"benefit adjustments\" would be necessary to make the system solvent. The flurry of reports and statements left unclear whether AARP was opening up to new concessions in the debate over Social Security, as several lawmakers place reform proposals on the table. The Wall Street Journal first reported Friday that the AARP, which opposed President George W. Bush's push to partially privatize Social Security, has decided to accept cuts -- though it would reportedly push for tax hikes to close most of the long-term Social Security shortfall. AARP CEO Barry Rand later issued a statement calling the article \"misleading\" and claiming \"AARP has not changed its position on Social Security.\" He said AARP remains opposed to cutting Social Security for the sake of deficit reduction and to any privatization plan. \"We are currently fighting proposals to cut Social Security to pay the nation's bills,\" he said. However, AARP legislative policy director David Certner told Fox News that Social Security needs a \"package of revenue and benefit adjustments ... to make it solvent.\" While the AARP claims its position on strengthening Social Security remains unchanged, others outside the organization detected a shift. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who on Thursday unveiled her own Social Security reform package, said Friday that the AARP has marked \"a huge shift in the debate on the solvency of Social Security.\" \"AARP's new and welcome position is a positive step towards the type of reforms I've championed, and I look forward to working with the organization to shape the changes in a way that makes the least detrimental impact to present and future retirees,\" she said in a statement. There is still plenty of space between the kind of plan Hutchison is calling for and what groups like the AARP would accept. Hutchison's plan does not include tax hikes. Her office claims the bill would cut deficits by $416 billion over the next decade and keep Social Security solvent by instead raising the retirement age to 69 over 16 years and cutting yearly cost-of-living adjustments by 1 percent. Workers who are 58 and older would not be affected. \"Those two things would keep our Social Security system solvent for 75 years with really, I think, minor pain and a big gain,\" she told Fox News on Thursday. But the AARP has told Fox News that Hutchison's proposal is not acceptable. Asked about the possibility of Social Security entering budget talks at some point, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney reiterated past statements in saying President Obama does not see Social Security as a \"driver\" of the country's near-term deficits. \"The president supports measures to strengthen Social Security, but he does not support anything that would slash benefits for future generations,\" Carney said Friday. The back-and-forth comes amid new warnings about the future of Social Security. Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund last week warned the Social Security Trust Fund will be exhausted in 2036 and under current law, seniors would then face a 23 percent across-the-board cut in benefits. But the president's budget director told Fox News that even when the trust funds run out, both Social Security and Medicare would still have some income. \"We have a little bit of time,\" said Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget. \"We do have a challenge, but it's not that we fall off of a cliff.\" With AARP potentially backing off its opposition, other groups are poised to take up the fight. A coalition of groups called Strengthen Social Security has railed against cuts to cost-of-living adjustments, recently releasing a report claiming \"even the modest COLA on which Social Security benefits are adjusted isn't safe.\"",

In a winding speech that touched as much on his personal turmoil as his policies and politics, Beck had the packed auditorium at CPAC captivated from the start. Using hand gestures, multiple impersonations and his infamous chalkboard, he took the usual swipes at Democrats. \"Progressivism,\" he declared, \"is eating the Constitution.\" Moreover, it \"was designed to eat the Constitution.\" But the nearly hour-long address was spent not bemoaning his ideological foes, but rather demanding purity among his likely allies. If last year's CPAC keynote speech - delivered by radio host Rush Limbaugh - was defined by urging President Barack Obama to fail, Beck's stood out for his demand that conservatism succeed. \"Dick Cheney a couple days ago... says it is going to be a good year for conservative ideas,\" he declared at one point, wiping the sweat from his brow. \"It is going to be a very good year. But it is not enough just to not suck as much as the other side.\" And who, exactly, sucked as much as the other side? Beck didn't really name names - save for a swipe at one Republican (presumably Sen. John McCain) for admiring another Republican, Teddy Roosevelt -- the latter of whom Beck accused of launching the modern progressive movement. But the message was clear: supporting anything that closely resembled the Democratic agenda would no longer fly with the modern GOP. \"I have not heard people in the Republican Party admit yet that they have a problem,\" he said. \"I haven't seen the Come-To-Jesus moment from Republicans yet.\" \"One party will tax and spend,\" he added at another point. 'One party won't tax and will spend. It is both of them together.\" The plea was made all the more effective by the intertwining of Beck's own story of struggle and redemption. Pointing to his time as a recovering alcoholic, the Fox News host urged the GOP to embark on a 12-step program of recovery. \"Hello, my name is the Republican Party, and I got a problem. I'm addicted to spending and big government,\" he declared, reading out the apology he wanted lawmakers to deliver. Reflecting on his own lack of formal education, he railed against government handouts - extending the logic to argue against a right to health care. The crowd was enthralled, even as Beck took them down winding tales of Calvin Coolidge, the Statute of Liberty and the supposed great middle class explosion of the 1920s. But was the message what the conservative movement needed to hear? Tradition dictates that political parties out of power do what they can to expand their coalition. Elections, after all, are won when candidates broaden their appeal to the voters responsible for electing them. For Beck and the surrounding CPAC crowd, however, ideological purity was the path to redemption and recovery. All we've heard, the Fox News host complained, is \"we need a big tent. We need a big tent. Can we get a bigger tent? How can we get a big tent? What is this the circus? America is not a clown show. America is not a circus. America is an idea. America is an idea that sets people free.\"",

Asa Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas, spoke on Wednesday about the future of what proponents call the religious freedom bill pending in his state, he disclosed that the proposal had drawn resistance from a particularly noteworthy critic: his son, Seth Hutchinson. But to people familiar with the Hutchinsons, long one of the most influential families in Arkansas, the news was hardly a bombshell. \u201cIt would be surprising to me if he didn\u2019t do that,\u201d said Shawn Standefer, a childhood friend of the younger Mr. Hutchinson who captained their national championship-winning Quiz Bowl team in high school. \u201cHe\u2019s always been concerned with justice, however he\u2019s thought of it.\u201d And so it was on Saturday, with lawmakers nearing a vote on the legislation that critics said would legalize discrimination against gay people, that the younger Mr. Hutchinson wrote to his father and warned that the proposal could damage Arkansas\u2019s reputation and economy. It was only the latest chapter in a politically complicated relationship between Asa Hutchinson, a former congressman, and Seth Hutchinson, 31, an organizer for the Texas State Employees Union. \u201cI love my dad, and we have a good, close relationship,\u201d Seth Hutchinson said on Wednesday. \u201cBut we disagree a lot on political issues. This is just another one, but a lot of families disagree politically. But we stay close.\u201d Mr. Hutchinson has not always been what he described as the family\u2019s political \u201cblack sheep.\u201d \u201cI kind of grew up on the campaign trail,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a political opinion just came naturally to me. At first, I pretty much followed the values that my family and my parents laid out for me.\u201d But, starting when he was about 15 and working as a dishwasher at a diner, Mr. Hutchinson\u2019s views began to change as he shuffled through other jobs, including stints at Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s and Sears. He grew frustrated when he saw older workers enduring financial hardships in low-paying jobs. \u201cIt just showed me that there\u2019s something wrong,\u201d he said, adding that he became interested in gay rights at about the same time, when friends began discussing their sexual orientations and after the arrest of an art teacher, who was gay. \u201cHe was not out,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said of the teacher. \u201cAnd he was arrested in a park \u2014 I think the official charge was attempting to loiter \u2014 and it was obvious he was there because he couldn\u2019t be out and keep his job.\u201d Mr. Hutchinson had robust political discussions with his father even as a high school student, long before their views diverged so vastly. \u201cHe would defend his views,\u201d Mr. Standefer said. \u201cAnd as they changed, he tried to stand by his new views.\u201d Mr. Hutchinson spent a year at Georgetown University before enrolling at the University of Central Arkansas, where he joined groups like the Young Democratic Socialists, and rallied for gay rights during the tenure of another Republican, Gov. Mike Huckabee. He would contact a cousin, Tim C. Hutchinson, who sat in the State House of Representatives, to register his views. Seth Hutchinson later moved to Texas and became a labor activist, which the governor mentions to left-leaning audiences. Father and son communicate regularly, Seth Hutchinson said, and the family gathers at least once or twice a year. \u201cIt\u2019s always a lively and engaging conversation,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said. On Wednesday, the governor said he would ask lawmakers to either recall or rewrite portions of the bill. Seth Hutchinson, though, refused to take credit. \u201cI did not sway my dad,\u201d he said. \u201cI think my dad is rethinking this because of the pressure that\u2019s coming at him from all sides.\u201d",

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) were made public. At a January fundraiser in Texas, Braley urged the attorneys present to contribute to his campaign and contrasted his background with Grassley's. \"If you help me win this race, you may have someone with your background, your experience, your voice ... on the Senate Judiciary Committee,\" Braley said. \"Or you might have a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, never practiced law, serving as the next chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee,\" he continued, referring to Grassley. Braley's remarks were released Tuesday by America Rising, a conservative political action committee which conducts opposition research on Democrats. One of the Republican primary field's leading candidates, businessman Mark Jacobs, immediately released a radio ad in an attempt to capitalize on the negative attention focused on Braley. Both the Des Moines Register and the Quad-City Times featured the backlash over Braley\u2019s comments on their front pages. Braley apologized to Grassley in person on Tuesday after state Republican Party leaders and a number of Braley's potential Republican general election opponents condemned his remarks. The representative also posted a statement Tuesday in which he apologized and emphasized that he has farmers in his family. \u201cI apologize to Sen. Grassley and anyone I may have offended,\u201d Braley wrote. \u201cMy parents both grew up on Iowa farms during the Great Depression.

        "body": " The House of Representatives on Friday approved a sweeping election reform bill that serves as the touchstone to the House Democratic agenda but has been criticized by civil libertarians and Republicans over First Amendment concerns. The so-called \u201cHR 1\u201d measure embraced by House Democrats aims to curb big money in politics, make it easier to vote and bolster election security. It institutes a public financing system for congressional campaigns, requires presidential candidates to disclose tax returns and makes Election Day a federal holiday. The House approved the plan 234-193. But the measure is not expected to succeed in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said the bill is dead on arrival. The American Civil Liberties Union, in a recent letter to Congress, encouraged lawmakers to vote against the bill because of \u201cprovisions that unconstitutionally impinge on the free speech rights of American citizens and public interest organizations.\u201d \u201cThey will have the effect of harming our public discourse by silencing necessary voices that would otherwise speak out about the public issues of the day,\u201d the ACLU wrote. One concern of civil libertarians is the bill\u2019s inclusion of the DISCLOSE ACT, which would require all organizations that spend money on elections to disclose donors. The ACLU said it supports making organizations report spending for public communications like TV ads that expressly call for the election or defeat of a candidate for office, but it worries the DISCLOSE ACT goes beyond that. \u201cThese standards are unclear and entirely subjective, which will lead to confusion and, ultimately, less speech,\u201d the ACLU said. Republicans called the bill a Democratic power grab that amounts to a federal takeover of elections. \u201cNow, instead of getting money out of politics, the Democrats on this committee voted to pass a bill that will publicly fund \u2013 campaign travel, campaign dinners, and in some cases, the politicians themselves,\u201d Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis wrote in an op-ed for The Hill. The White House said in a statement that the Democrats' plan would \"micromanage\" elections that now are run largely by states and would establish \"costly and unnecessary program to finance political campaigns.\" But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bill \"restores the people's faith that government works for the public interest, the people's interest, not the special interests.\" Trying to turn Republicans' words against them, Pelosi said, \"Yes it is a power grab -- a power grab on behalf of the people.\" House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California said the legislation would undermine the integrity of elections by allowing convicted felons to vote, and would apply a one-size-fits-all standard to elections now run by states and local governments. Democrats called that a mischaracterization. To Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., the bill \"grabs power away from the elites and the power brokers and gives it to the people.\" She and other Democrats disputed the claim that taxpayers will pay for campaigns, noting that money for political campaigns would come from a surcharge on federal settlements made with banks and corporations that run afoul of the law.",

        "body": " Trump Lashes Out at Kathy Griffin and Democrats WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump assailed Democrats and a television comedian on Wednesday in his latest Twitter blasts since returning from an overseas trip in which he had largely abstained from the sort of combative social media postings that helped propel him to the Oval Office and have gotten him in trouble ever since. The president castigated Kathy Griffin, the celebrity comic and author, for posing for a video showing her holding what looks like the severed and bloodied head of Mr. Trump. The video touched off a storm of protests from people on all sides of the political spectrum, which forced Ms. Griffin to apologize, and CNN announced that it would fire her from the annual New Year\u2019s Eve program she has co-hosted. In a statement later in the day, the first lady, Melania Trump, questioned Ms. Griffin\u2019s sanity. \u201cAs a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.\u201d The Trumps had the support of the daughter of the woman the president beat in last year\u2019s election, among others. Ms. Griffin went online on Tuesday night to express regret. \u201cI sincerely apologize,\u201d she said in a video. \u201cI\u2019m just now seeing the reaction of these images. I\u2019m a comic. I crossed the line. I move the line, I cross it. I went way too far. The image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasn\u2019t funny. I get it.\u201d She said she had asked the photographer to pull the images. \u201cI beg for your forgiveness,\u201d she continued. \u201cI went too far. I made a mistake and I was wrong.\u201d She did not address Mr. Trump specifically in her video. CNN, which has enlisted Ms. Griffin to host New Year\u2019s Eve programming alongside Anderson Cooper for the last decade, announced on Wednesday that she would no longer appear. Mr. Cooper distanced himself, as well. Mr. Trump also lashed out at Democrats in Congress whom he accused of trying to squelch testimony involving the investigation into Russian meddling in last year\u2019s election. Shortly after a \u201cFox and Friends\u201d segment reporting that Democrats no longer want to hear testimony from Carter Page, a onetime Trump campaign adviser, Mr. Trump wrote that it was all part of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him. \u201cSo now it is reported that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, don\u2019t want him to testify,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe blows away their case against him & now wants to clear his name by showing \u2018the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan \u2026\u2019 Witch Hunt!\u201d In a letter to the House Intelligence Committee reported by Fox and other news organizations, Mr. Page wrote: \u201cI have learned from your Committee staff on this Memorial Day holiday that I might not be immediately afforded the opportunity to address the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan, et al. as per our previously scheduled appointment for next week. In the interest of finally providing the American people with some accurate information at long last, I hope that we can proceed with this straight dialogue soon.\u201d Mr. Page did not list what testimony he considered false by Mr. Comey, who was fired by Mr. Trump as director of the F.B.I., or Mr. Brennan, the former director of the C.I.A., who stepped down when President Barack Obama left office in January. But Mr. Page urged the committee \u201cto investigate the growing evidence of collusion between Clinton campaign associates, Comey and other former Obama administration officials.\u201d",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans are preparing to unveil their own broad template for overhauling the nation\u2019s immigration system this week, potentially offering a small opening for President Obama and congressional Democrats to pass bipartisan legislation before the end of the year. Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders are expected to release a one-page statement of immigration principles this week at their annual retreat in Cambridge, Md., according to aides with knowledge of the plan. The document is expected to call for border security and enforcement measures, as well as providing a path to legal status \u2014 but not citizenship \u2014 for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, the aides said. The Republican effort comes as Mr. Obama is expected to push once again for an overhaul of the immigration system in his State of the Union address Tuesday, and as lawmakers from both parties describe immigration as one of the few potential areas for bipartisan compromise before the end of the current Congress. \u201cThe principles they lay out I\u2019m sure won\u2019t satisfy everybody,\u201d Michael R. Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City, said at an immigration forum on Friday. But, he added, \u201cif we can make some compromises here for the good of the country, I think we have a very good chance for the first time in a long time of changing something that is really damaging all of us.\u201d The Senate, led by Democrats, passed a broad bipartisan measure in June to overhaul immigration that included a 13-year path to citizenship. But the legislation stalled in the Republican-controlled House, where some of the party\u2019s more conservative members oppose any form of legal status as \u201camnesty.\u201d But heading into the three-day Republican retreat, even some of the most ardent conservatives say consensus is forming around an immigration package that would include several separate bills on border security; a clampdown against the hiring of undocumented workers; expanded guest-worker programs; a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children; and a path to legal status for undocumented workers with family ties to citizens or employer sponsors. The White House has said it wants a path to citizenship for both children and adults in any new immigration legislation. \u201cThe president\u2019s pathway to citizenship is a stumbling block,\u201d said Representative Andy Harris, a conservative Republican who represents the Maryland district that will host the retreat. \u201cBut legalization with no path to citizenship can gain some votes.\u201d Representative Peter T. King, a Republican of New York and a longtime critic of proposals to change the immigration system, said it was significant that both the third-ranking Republican in the House, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, and the Judiciary Committee chairman, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, had voiced support in recent days for legal status for some immigrants living in the country illegally \u2014 and have taken very little heat for their remarks on either side of the aisle. But the divisions that have slowed progress in the House have not been entirely mended. Representative Ra\u00fal R. Labrador, a Republican of Idaho and once a leading immigration negotiator in the House, said it would be a mistake to push forward. \u201cThe president has shown he\u2019s not willing to work with us on immigration,\u201d Mr. Labrador said. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth having a party divided when we have so many issues we can come together on.\u201d On Thursday, aides to House conservatives who oppose the leadership\u2019s plan gathered in the office of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and a fierce opponent of the immigration push, to plot a strategy to torpedo it. Critics worry that House Republican leaders and Senate Democrats are essentially negotiating a final deal, bypassing formal House-Senate negotiations, where conservatives had hoped to derail the process. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, one of the Democratic architects of the Senate bill, said: \u201cOne thing is certain, just as with the budget, at some point both the House and the Senate will have to sit down and resolve all the contentious issues.\u201d",

Mike Pence of Indiana, moving to address a growing political firestorm over a religious freedom law enacted last week, said over the weekend that he would seek legislation to clarify the intent of the law, and rejected assertions that it sanctioned discrimination against gays and lesbians. The governor, a Republican, told The Indianapolis Star on Saturday that he was taken aback by negative reactions to the state\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which he signed into law on Thursday. He told the newspaper that he expected legislation clarifying the law to be introduced in the General Assembly this week, but offered no details. The law aims to protect individuals or companies from being forced to take actions that impose a substantial burden on their religious beliefs. Proponents say the law should allow Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without fear of legal reprisals. \u201cI support religious liberty, and I support this law,\u201d the governor said. \u201cBut we are in discussions with legislative leaders this weekend to see if there\u2019s a way to clarify the intent of the law.\u201d Mr. Pence appeared on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, and the host, George Stephanopoulos, asked him whether signing the law was a mistake. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Mr. Pence said, adding later: \u201cI signed the bill. We\u2019re going to continue to explain it to people who don\u2019t understand it, and if possible, we will find a way to amplify what this bill really is in the legislative process.\u201d But his answers to other questions were less clear. Mr. Pence did not directly answer whether the law might protect, for example, a Christian florist who denied service to a gay couple. Asserting that the legislation was not about discrimination, he said, \u201cThe issue here is, you know, is tolerance a two-way street or not?\u201d On Saturday, thousands of protesters gathered at the Statehouse as businesses and other governments announced a halt to business with the state and the capital, Indianapolis, over the law. Marc Benioff, the chief executive officer of Salesforce.com, said on Thursday that his company would halt all corporate travel to Indiana. On Saturday, Mayor Ed Murray of Seattle announced a ban on city employees traveling to Indiana for work using city funds. The same day, Bill Oesterle, the chief executive officer of Angie\u2019s List, said his company would abandon a deal with Indiana and Indianapolis to expand its headquarters. His opposition was seen as an indication of dissatisfaction with the law beyond the liberal political left; he was the campaign director for Mitch Daniels\u2019s successful Republican bid for governor in 2004. The debate cast a shadow over preparations in Indianapolis for the N.C.A.A. men\u2019s basketball tournament, which will take place in Indianapolis on Saturday and next Monday. In a statement on Thursday, the N.C.A.A. president, Mark Emmert, said the organization was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the legislation. \u201cWe intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our work force,\u201d he said. The backlash has been an unexpected political headache for Mr. Pence, who is juggling whether to run for re-election or for president in 2016. Defending the law in the interviews with The Star and Mr. Stephanopoulos, the governor pointed to its origins in federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton and adopted by about 19 other states. Indiana\u2019s bill was drafted from a version that President Obama voted for when he was a state senator in Illinois, Mr. Pence said. Critics, however, say the Indiana law includes different wording that could open the door to wider discrimination. Critics also note that in many of the states with similar laws, including Illinois, sexual orientation is protected under civil rights law. In Indiana, gays and lesbians are not a protected class. When asked if he would seek those protections, the governor said that he would not. \u201cThat\u2019s not on my agenda,\u201d he said on \u201cThis Week.\u201d",

Democrats countered initially with $1.3 billion for general border security, while Trump said initially he would not sign anything without wall funding. In the last few weeks, the fight turned particularly nasty -- with Trump canceling a Democratic congressional trip to Afghanistan after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on Trump to delay his State of the Union address or submit it in writing.  Trump announced Thursday that he would delay the address, but if the government re-opens then it could take place on Tuesday as had been previously scheduled. After bills to re-open the government failed in the Senate Thursday, Trump signaled that a \"large down payment\" on funding, potentially less than the $5.7 billion, could be sufficient to end the stalemate.  He suggested that a \"prorated down payment\" on the wall, without providing a concrete dollar figure, could be viable. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., had also suggested that a three-week continuing resolution could be the way forward. \"If they come to a reasonable agreement, I would support that,\" Trump told reporters. The partial closure of the government has led to hundreds of thousands of workers furloughed or working without pay, with groups representing the workers increasing their calls for D.C. to end the deadlock and get workers paid again.  Many workers missed their second paycheck on Friday. Every former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, including former White House chief of staff John Kelly, sent a letter to the president and Congress on Thursday asking them restore the department\u2019s funding. \u201cDHS employees who protect the traveling public, investigate and counter terrorism, and protect critical infrastructure should not have to rely on the charitable generosity of others for assistance in feeding their families and paying their bills while they steadfastly focus on the mission at hand,\u201d the letter said.  \u201cThis is unconscionable.\u201d President Trump on Saturday announced a compromise plan that funded the wall while extending protections for 700,000 illegal immigrants brought to the country as children and 300,000 immigrants from countries designated unsafe to return.  However, Democrats rejected the plan even before Trump announced it, and a Senate version of the plan failed to get the 60 votes needed on Thursday.  A second bill, already passed by the Democrat-controlled House to re-open the government, also fell short. On Thursday, Trump had promised that Republicans \u201cwill not cave\" on border wall demands. ",

        "body": " Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick on Wednesday picked a former chief of staff to fill Sen. John Kerry\u2019s open seat until a special election in June. The Democratic governor picked former Chief of Staff William \"Mo\" Cowan, who also served as Patrick\u2019s chief legal counsel. Kerry, also a Democrat and the state\u2019s senior U.S. senator, was confirmed Tuesday as the new secretary of state, following his nomination by President Obama to replace the retiring Hillary Clinton. Both political parties will hold special-election primaries in mid May. But the winner of the Democratic primary will be a likely favorite to win the June 25 special general election, considering Massachusetts is among the most liberal states in the country. Patrick also announced the general election date Wednesday. Among the potential Democratic candidates are Reps. Stephen F. Lynch, Michael E. Capuano and Edward Markey. The most high-profile potential Republican candidate is former Sen. Scott Brown, who pulled off a surprise 2010 victory in the race for the open seat of Sen. Ted Kennedy. However, Brown lost his re-election bid in November to Democrat Elizabeth Warren. Cowan joined the Patrick administration in 2009 and reportedly quit earlier this month to join private practice. He previously practiced civil litigation at the Boston office of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo PC, where he was a partner. He also was a special assistant district attorney in the Office of the Middlesex County District Attorney. Cowan is a graduate of Duke University and Northeastern University School of Law. He and wife Stacy have two young sons. \u201cI am confident this is the right and best choice,\u201d Patrick said at a late-morning press conference. The appointment marks the first time in Senate history that two black senators have served at the same time. \u201cI\u2019m not standing here because I\u2019m a person of color, but because (the governor) believes I can do the job,\u201d said Cowen, who joins South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott as the chamber\u2019s two black senators. Cowmen also emphasized that his assignment is \u201ctemporary\u201d and that he will work together with Kerry\u2019s team. Patrick gave little indication who he favored during his deliberations. The only possible candidate he confirmed speaking with was former Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, and then only after Frank told reporters he'd spoken with Patrick. Michael Dukakis, the former governor and 1988 Democratic presidential nominee, and Victoria Kennedy, Sen. Kennedy\u2019s widow, had also been mentioned as possible candidates for the interim post.",

Trump took the oath of office Friday to become the 45th president of the United States. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the 38-word oath at 12:00 p.m., capping Trump\u2019s unlikely journey from New York City real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation\u2019s highest office. Trump won the Republican nomination against a crowded field of 16 other candidates, many far more experienced in politics. But he was able to capitalize on a primary voting base that was angry at the establishment GOP for not more aggressively fighting President Barack Obama\u2019s policies. He trailed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election nearly the entire way. In the final month of the race, he was helped by the near daily release of internal Democratic Party emails stolen by Russian hackers as well as by FBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision to reopen, briefly, the probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server.

        "body": " Rep. Joe Sestak (D-Penn.) was offered a prominent but uncompensated, advisory position -- in the national security/foreign policy area -- if he declined to enter the Pennsylvania Senate primary race, a source with knowledge of the exchange said during a briefing on Friday morning. The offer was made by White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel through a prominent intermediary -- former President Bill Clinton -- during the months of June and July of 2009. The White House initiated the conversation, which occurred over phone. It would have allowed Sestak to remain in the House of Representatives while advising the president. The source said it would not be surprising if more than one conversation took place, though there were no other intermediaries involved. Sestak ultimately rejected the overture and went on to defeat incumbent Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Penn) in the Democratic primary election earlier this month. \"By virtue of his career in public service, including distinguished military service, Congressman Sestak was viewed to be highly qualified to hold a range of advisory positions in which he could, while holding his House seat, have additional responsibilities of considerable potential interest to him and value to the Executive Branch,\" a memo detailing the administration's findings reads. The account offered by the source was the most detailed to date from primary sources as to the conversations they had with Sestak regarding his entrance into the Pennsylvania race. News of the Clinton conversation was first reported by Greg Sargent at The Plum Line. The source challenged one major aspect of the story line, insisting that the White House never offered Sestak the job of Secretary of the Navy. The offer for that position was made more than a month before -- on March 26, 2009 -- to Ray Mabus. Administration officials had spent time and capital recruiting Senator Arlen Specter to switch parties and run for re-election as a Democrat. Part of that arrangement entailed clearing the field for his nomination. When Sestak began making overtures that he would run, the White House looked for ways to follow through on its promise. What resulted were the informal conversation(s). Since then, much intrigue has surrounded what conversations actually took place. Sestak brought the issue to the surface when he alluded to a job offer early in his primary run. But he refused to provide details, such as who approached him and what position was dangled in front of him. The White House, when pressed on the matter, had been vague. Press Secretary Robert Gibbs declined repeated attempts for comment before relaying to reporters that he and White House lawyers had looked into the matter and found it legally permissible. Behind the scenes, White House Counsel Bob Bauer's office began investigating the matter when stories first surfaced. The investigation was internal at first with the White House reaching conclusions at least two-and-a-half months ago. As part of the process, however, Bauer also interviewed representatives for Sestak and Clinton -- in this case Sestak's brother and Doug Brand and Bruce Lindsey respectively. The congressman and the former president were not contacted for Bauer's investigation. The source insisted that no laws were broken in the process of offering the position, that the matter hardly rose to the level of political scandal -- suggesting that Republicans on the Hill were hoping to reap political benefits from the saga. It certainly wasn't historically unique. As the Huffington Post reported on Thursday, various political historians and ethics lawyers have approached the Sestak news with yawns, noting that quid pro quos and backroom job offers are fairly common in administrations.",

        "body": " New York \u2013 In his first major foreign policy speech since launching his presidential campaign, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio said if elected, he would prioritize a strong military, take aggressive steps to fight nations that undermine global commerce and ensure that U.S. is a world moral leader. The Florida Republican, who delivered his speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan on Wednesday, said that the United States was losing its place as a world military and moral power because of what he depicted as the Obama administration\u2019s overly cautious responses to crises overseas. \u201cSince the end of the Cold War, the threats facing America have changed, but the need for American strength has not,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cIt has only grown more pressing as the world has grown more interconnected.\u201d \u201cIt takes forethought to design and many years to build the capabilities we may need at a moment\u2019s notice,\" the 43-year-old said. \"So to restore American strength, my first priority will be to adequately fund our military. This would be a priority even in times of peace and stability, though the world today is neither peaceful nor stable.\u201d Rubio repeated his characterization of Obama as a president so concerned with softening any perception other nations has of the United States as a bully that he erred in acting in the other extreme, eager to acquiesce to foreign governments that have thumbed their noses at the U.S. and international laws. \u201c[Obama] demonstrated a disregard for our moral purpose that at times flirted with disdain,\u201d said Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants. \u201cHe criticized America for having \u2018arrogance\u2019 and the audacity to \u2018dictate our terms\u2019 to other nations. From his reset with Russia, to his open hand to Iran, to his unreciprocated opening to Cuba, he has embraced regimes that systematically oppose every principle our nation has long championed.\u201d Rubio also said that the United States must move decisively when aggressive nations such as China and Iran attempt to undermine the economic interests of the United States as well as other nations. \"Russia, China, Iran or any other nation that attempts to block global commerce will know to expect a response from my administration.\u201d The Democratic National Committee issued a brief statement shortly after Rubio's speech: \u201cOkay. So here\u2019s Rubio\u2019s alleged \u2018new\u2019 foreign policy. Troops in the Middle East permanently. A Cuba policy that is stuck in the Cold War. Unwillingness to even start a discussion of a two state solution. Keeping Guantanamo Bay open. No plan forward on Iran.\" And it ended with: \u201cNeoconservative meets Cold War: that\u2019s the Rubio doctrine.\u201d Rubio\u2019s foreign policy agenda \u2013 often hawkish in approach \u2013 has been a hallmark of his service in the Senate, and now in his campaign. He says that as a member of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the Senate Committee on Intelligence, he is privy to information that form the basis of his decision on how the United States must approach foreign policy. Rubio said Obama \"wasted no time stripping parts from the engine of American strength,\" and cast former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as his loyal deputy. \"[Clinton] was the chief architect of a foreign policy that was a disaster,\" he said during an interview with Charlie Rose following the speech. \"We simply cannot afford to elect as our next president one of the leading agents of this administration's foreign policy \u2014 a leader from yesterday whose tenure as secretary of state was ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst,\" Rubio said, according to the prepared text of remarks he was to deliver at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. He even has taken tougher stances on foreign policy than some of his Republican colleagues, who have softened their views on diplomatic relations with Cuba \u2013 to which Rubio objects \u2013 and how to handle the nuclear talks with Iran. Some in the GOP have called for spending cuts in military spending, with which he disagrees. As he often has in Senate hearings, Rubio assailed Obama for stressing dialogues and diplomacy over ironclad dealings with heads of foreign governments that have been openly hostile to the United States, and which continue to exercise oppression against political dissidents. \u201cThe world is at its safest when America is at its strongest,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWhen America has the mightiest Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and intelligence community in the world, the result is more peace, not more conflict.\u201d Rubio said, after his speech, in a question-and-answer session with TV host Charlie Rose, that \"Obama has embraced regimes that systematically opposed our principles.\" Rose asked Rubio what he though of Pope Francis's embrace of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba. Rubio said his priorities and those of the pope's are by necessity different. He defended keeping the embargo. He said having anything to do with Cuba is to avail oneself of properties stolen from Cubans by the Cuban government during the revolution. Rubio said the embargo is not to blame for Cuba's failed economy. He said the rest of the world does not have an embargo against Cuba. So why, he asked, does Cuba not have Toyotas or modern goods from other nations? As for Iran, Rubio said it cannot be trusted. \"Iran has always had a secret component to its nuclear program,\" he said. \"They know once international sanctions are lifted, they can never be reimposed.\"",

        "body": " President Trump vowed Wednesday that birthright citizenship will end \u201cone way or the other,\u201d a day after it emerged he was considering killing the policy by executive order -- a development that sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats. \u201cSo-called Birthright Citizenship, which costs our Country billions of dollars and is very unfair to our citizens, will be ended one way or the other,\u201d he tweeted.  \"It is not covered by the 14th Amendment because of the words 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'\" He also took aim at former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who he said \u201cwas right in 1993, before he and the Democrats went insane and started with the Open Borders (which brings massive crime) \u2018stuff.\u2019\u201d He was referring to comments unearthed from 1993 in which Reid said that \"no sane country\" would award citizenship to children of illegal immigrants born on its soil and promoted legislation to end the practice. \"If making it easy to be an illegal alien isn't enough, how about offering a reward for being an illegal immigrant?  No sane country would do that, right?\" Reid said.  \"Guess again.  If you break our laws by entering this country without permission and give birth to a child, we reward that child with U.S. citizenship and guarantee a full access to all public and social services this society provides.\" Reid later apologized for his stance and reversed it in 1999. But the comments helped Trump make his controversial case, after his push first emerged in an interview with \u201cAxios on HBO\u201d.  He said he wants to use an executive order to end the practice by which children born in the U.S. of non-citizen or illegal immigrant parents are immediately a citizen. \u201cHow ridiculous, we\u2019re the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits,\u201d Trump said. The U.S. is not the only country to grant birthright citizenship, with Canada and a number of Latin American countries also doing so, but the issue has long been a contentious one in the U.S. -- particularly for those seeking to restrict illegal immigration into the U.S. The 14th Amendment states that \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d  Critics of birthright citizenship say that the amendment was never intended to apply to children of two non-citizens -- and particularly those who have come to the country illegally. Critics say the policy encourages illegal immigrants to come to the country, give birth and then try to claim residency themselves as a result. But many scholars counter that it would take a constitutional amendment to change the policy.  And the announcement Tuesday was met with a mixed reception by lawmakers in Congress, particularly the idea that Trump might use an executive order to impose such a significant immigration change -- something Republicans blasted former President Barack Obama for doing with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in an interview with WVLK that the 14th Amendment is \u201cpretty clear\u201d and said that \u201cyou cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order.\u201d  Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he will \"closely review\" the proposed executive order, but said that \"as a general matter, this is an issue that Congress should take the lead to carefully consider and debate.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., announced he will be introducing legislation \u201cto deal with the issue of birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants\u201d and said it was a \u201cmagnet for illegal immigration in modern times.\u201d On Wednesday, Trump appeared to shift stance somewhat by avoiding saying it would be ended by executive order, while acknowledging the matter \u201cwill be settled by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d Democrats appeared united in condemnation against Trump\u2019s move this week.  In a Tuesday appearance on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the Axios interview didn't surprise her. \"This is just more of the same of what he's been saying,\" she said, referring to Trump's remarks on immigration.  \"What he was saying today has no relationship to what his authority is, but that's of course not unusual.\"",

        "body": " President Obama formally endorsed Hillary Clinton to succeed him in the White House Thursday, saying she has the \"courage\" for the job and vowing to hit the campaign trail for her soon -- in a video message posted just moments after meeting with her primary rival Bernie Sanders. \"I know how hard this job can be. That\u2019s why I know Hillary will be so good at it,\" the president said, in the video posted on Clinton's campaign site. \"In fact, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office.\" The president made clear he would no longer stand on the sidelines, even as Vermont Sen. Sanders vows to stick out the race at least through the final primary in Washington, D.C., next Tuesday. The Clinton campaign separately announced that she and Obama would campaign together June 15 in Green Bay. Clinton tweeted that she's \"fired up.\" Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump immediately fired back. To which the Clinton campaign tweeted: \u201cDelete your account.\u201d Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden voiced his support of Hillary Thursday evening at the American Constitution Society's national convention. \"Anybody who thinks that whoever the next president is -- and God willing, in my view, it will be Secretary Clinton.\" The White House, meanwhile, said Obama recorded the video on Tuesday, the day Clinton effectively wrapped up the nomination. The video was released shortly after Obama met in the Oval Office with Sanders. Sanders afterward struck a conciliatory tone Thursday, saying he plans to meet soon with Clinton to discuss how they can \u201cwork together to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d The Vermont senator said he still plans to compete in next Tuesday\u2019s Washington, D.C., primary, the final contest on the calendar. And he said he plans to take his message \u201cto the Democratic National Convention\u201d in July. He did not, however, say specifically whether he would still be an active candidate by then, taking no questions from the press before heading over to a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. The meeting with Obama was private. They met for over an hour, and Fox News is told no staff or aides were present. But his tone, compared with his defiant speech early Wednesday after Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination, appeared to soften. While offering no endorsement himself, Sanders said he spoke with Clinton and congratulated her \u201con her very strong campaign.\u201d And Sanders thanked Obama for his \u201cimpartiality\u201d throughout the process. He said he and Vice President Biden lived up to their pledge not to put their \u201cthumb on the scales.\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest later said Sanders has the right to make campaign decisions on his own timeline. Another former primary candidate, ex-Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, did endorse Clinton, saying \"it is time now to unite our party.\" Clinton and Obama, along with other party leaders, are eager to bring Sanders \u2013 and his supporters \u2013 into the fold. The president's endorsement reflects their desire to unify as the general election battle between Clinton and presumptive rival Trump intensifies. Sanders acknowledged a common political enemy, railing against Trump in his brief remarks to reporters Thursday afternoon and saying he\u2019ll do everything in his power to prevent Trump\u2019s election. As for what he wants, Sanders said he\u2019ll continue to fight what he called the \u201cdrift\u201d toward an oligarchic society. He lamented childhood poverty rates, crushing college debt, crumbling infrastructure and other woes and said these are the issues he\u2019ll bring to the Philadelphia convention. Whether that means a fight to overhaul the party platform \u2013 or a last-ditch bid to somehow deny Clinton the nomination \u2013 remains to be seen. One demand Sanders was thought to be considering \u2013 as part of a party-unity deal -- is the removal of Democratic boss Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Sanders and the DNC chairwoman have been at odds for months, with Sanders\u2019 team long accusing her of helping now-presumptive nominee Clinton. Whether Sanders sought \u2013 and the president would even consider \u2013 a Schultz sacrifice is unclear. \u201cI don\u2019t see how she makes it through the convention,\u201d one Democratic lawmaker told Fox News. \u201cThe key to Hillary winning is getting Sanders supporters on board.\u201d Speculation over Wasserman Schultz\u2019 position has swirled for months, however, and so far she has retained the public support of the White House. Obama also endorsed her earlier this year in her House primary battle. Asked Wednesday about the possibility of Sanders seeking her removal, Wasserman Schultz said she\u2019s not worried about her job. \u201cI'm going to be remaining as the chair of the Democratic National Committee as President Obama has asked me to do until January 21, 2017, and I appreciate the president\u2019s support,\u201d she said.",
