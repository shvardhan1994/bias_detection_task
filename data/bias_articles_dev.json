        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Friday reversed the government\u2019s decision to start allowing hunters to import trophies of elephants that were killed in two African countries, pending a further review. His evening Twitter message reversed a decision by his own administration over Zimbabwe that was announced this week and promoted as recently as Friday afternoon by the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \u201cPut big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cUnder study for years. Will update soon with Secretary Zinke. Thank you!\u201d Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, said in a statement later Friday night that the decision applied to two African countries, though it did not name them. \u201cPresident Trump and I have talked, and both believe that conservation and healthy herds are critical,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAs a result, in a manner compliant with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, the issuing of permits is being put on hold as the decision is being removed.\u201d The United States Fish and Wildlife Service had signaled its intention to end the 2014 ban, citing Zimbabwe\u2019s conservation efforts. On Thursday, the service announced on its website that it would begin issuing permits to allow the import of elephants hunted from 2016 to 2018, with two trophies allowed per import. Nearly two weeks ago, the department also waived the ban in a similar manner for Zambia. Zambia and Zimbabwe have had mixed success in recent years maintaining or increasing their elephant population, according to the Great Elephant Census, a project financed by Paul G. Allen, a founder of Microsoft. The project also found that the African elephant population shrunk nearly 30 percent from 2007 to 2014. It is unclear why Mr. Trump reversed the decision, but the announcement faced backlash from both conservatives and liberals. Laura Ingraham, a Fox News host, said Thursday on Twitter that she did not understand how the decision would not \u201cINCREASE the gruesome poaching of elephants,\u201d while the comedian Ellen DeGeneres started an online campaign, using the hashtag #BeKindToElephants, to raise funds for elephant conservation efforts. On social media, photos were being shared of Mr. Trump\u2019s two elder sons hunting on safari in Zimbabwe, including one photo that showed Donald Trump Jr. with a severed elephant tail in one hand and a knife in the other. The White House argued that the hunting would bring money to local communities and incentivize efforts to protect elephants. In defending the decision on Friday, Ms. Sanders cited a recently completed Park Service review that had begun during the Obama administration. \u201cThis review established that both Zambia and Zimbabwe had met new standards, strict international conservation standards that allowed Americans to resume hunting in those countries,\u201d she told reporters during a news briefing. Under President Barack Obama, the practice had been banned because of a lack of data on conservation efforts in Zimbabwe. Safari Club International, a trophy-hunting organization that sued the Obama administration in 2014 in an effort to challenge the ban and was the first to report the policy change on Tuesday, lashed out against the news media and \u201canti-hunters\u201d for swaying the Trump administration to lift the trophy ban. \u201cThe fight for the freedom to hunt is far from over,\u201d Paul Babaz, the organization\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cWe will be more proactive and not back down.\u201d But environmental groups applauded the reversal on Friday and called for more restrictions on trophy hunting, which has faced increased scrutiny, especially after an American dentist killed Cecil, a lion beloved in Zimbabwe, in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s great that public outrage has forced Trump to reconsider this despicable decision,\u201d said Tanya Sanerib, a senior lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity, \u201cbut it takes more than a tweet to stop trophy hunters from slaughtering elephants and lions.\u201d Ms. Sanders also confirmed Friday that a near-total ban on the commercial trade of African elephant ivory enforced during the Obama administration would remain in place.",

        "body": " PHILADELPHIA \u2015 Americans should vote for Hillary Clinton because, unlike Republican nominee Donald Trump, she is a \u201csane, competent person,\u201d Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and founder of the Bloomberg financial news and information empire, said at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday. The line was an unscripted addition to a speech in which Bloomberg criticized Democrats, but argued that Trump was a \u201cdangerous demagogue\u201d and a bad businessman who would be a disastrous president. \u201cI\u2019m a New Yorker,\u201d he said, \u201cand New Yorkers know a con when we see one.\u201d The billionaire ex-Republican, who has endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, made the case that Trump\u2019s career is characterized by a litany of collapses and missteps, and that the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s boasts don\u2019t match reality. Americans who want a great businessperson in the White House should look for someone who isn\u2019t Trump, Bloomberg said. \u201cThroughout his career, Trump has left behind a well-documented record of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits, angry stockholders and contractors who feel cheated and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cTrump says he wants to run the nation like he\u2019s running his business? God help us. Bloomberg\u2019s scathing speech seemed designed to chafe Trump\u2019s rawest nerves, mocking Trump\u2019s business prowess, his inheritance from his late father, his ego and his intellect. \u201cTruth be told, the richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy,\u201d Bloomberg said. Trump claims great wealth, but won\u2019t disclose his real net worth and refuses to release his tax returns. The real-estate developer also reacts defensively when his success is questioned. Bloomberg \u2015 who rivals Trump in unwavering self-assurance \u2015 favorably compared his own achievements in business and politics with Trump\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot of talk in this campaign about needing a leader who understands business. I couldn\u2019t agree more. I\u2019ve built a business \u2015 and I didn\u2019t start it with a million-dollar check from my father,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cBecause of my success in the private sector, I had the chance to run America\u2019s largest city for 12 years.\u201d Bloomberg weighed an independent bid for president this year because he objected to both Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Clinton\u2019s primary challenger. Bloomberg was a vocal critic of the Republican candidate \u2015 his former friend \u2015 long before backing Clinton\u2019s White House run. The financial industry tycoon ridiculed Trump\u2019s statements on immigration, national security, foreign trade, and his use of overseas labor. And Bloomberg made dire predictions about the damage a Trump presidency would wreak on virtually every aspect of American life. \u201cI understand the appeal of a businessman president,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cBut Trump\u2019s business plan is a disaster in the making. He would make it harder for small businesses to compete, do great damage to our economy, threaten the retirement savings of millions of Americans, lead to greater debt and more unemployment, erode our influence around the world and make our communities less safe.\u201d",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 With just three weeks left for lawmakers to avert a fiscal crisis, President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner met privately at the White House on Sunday as a top Republican senator suggested that his party should perhaps accede to Mr. Obama\u2019s demand to raise the top tax rates so that the attention can shift to making serious cuts in benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Administration officials would not offer details of the discussion between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner. But the disclosure of the meeting indicated that private discussions continue in the face of Republican leaders\u2019 public statements deploring the lack of progress and the president\u2019s refusal so far to specify the sort of deep, long-term reductions in spending for social programs that they insist upon as a condition of their support for raising taxes on high earners. The White House and Mr. Boehner\u2019s office issued identical statements afterward that said \u201cthe lines of communication remain open.\u201d The meeting was the first face-to-face negotiation between the president and the speaker since a session three weeks ago, when they were joined by the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California; the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada; and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. They were the first one-on-one deficit talks between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner since the summer of 2011, when the search for a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d on taxes and spending ultimately failed. The latest meeting gave rise to renewed optimism that a deal could be reached before the end of the month. \u201cMy guess is still that we will reach a deal, but I do not think that anything is either certain or imminent,\u201d Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican and Boehner lieutenant, said Sunday night. \u201cIf they reach a deal, I suspect the majority of our conference will support the speaker. I hope the president can command equal support on his side of the aisle.\u201d Any optimism is a step forward from Friday, when Mr. Boehner told reporters that he did not have a progress report because there was \u201cno progress to report.\u201d But the ups and downs of the search for a deal to avert a fiscal crisis have been in large measure for public consumption. Between public statements and news conferences, the staffs of the president and the speaker have been in close contact. Just hours before the White House meeting, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that a small but growing group of Republicans had begun considering acquiescing on tax rates so that the negotiations could shift to entitlement programs. Mr. Corker, a member of the Banking Committee who had presented a deficit-reduction plan of his own, said that if Republicans gave in to the president\u2019s chief demand, then \u201call of a sudden the shift goes back to entitlements, and maybe it puts us in a place where we actually can do something that really saves the nation.\u201d Republicans have been insisting that the Obama administration agree to substantial savings in entitlement programs as the two sides negotiate how to narrow the country\u2019s huge deficits. But Mr. Corker is part of a group of Republicans who say the party will ultimately have to yield to the Obama demand of higher tax rates for top earners, potentially back to the levels that prevailed under President Bill Clinton. That group of Republicans, Mr. Corker said on Fox, was beginning to realize \u201cthat we don\u2019t have a lot of cards as it relates to the tax issue before year end\u201d \u2014 but that a tax-rate concession could be converted, jujitsu style, into a tactical advantage. Mr. Corker\u2019s comments came as central figures on network news programs mixed cautious words of optimism over the negotiations between the White House and Congressional Republicans with dire warnings about what a failure to act might bring. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that such a failure was the gravest threat now facing the still-fragile United States economy \u2014 greater than the European debt crisis or any uncertainty in China. \u201cIt would result in the stock market really taking a hit,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said on the CNN program \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The overall result could be zero growth next year, not the 2.1 percent growth rate projected by the I.M.F. She called for a \u201cbalanced\u201d agreement of both revenue increases and spending cuts. That is a word Mr. Obama has often used to describe his preferred outcome. Ms. Lagarde offered a tentative prediction that what she called American \u201cpragmatism\u201d would prevail and avert the worst outcome.",

The backlash built quickly over the weekend as some prominent conservatives called for Steele's resignation. Speaking on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., would not go that far but said Steele must apologize to the troops. \"Chairman Steele needs to apologize to our military, all the men and women who've been fighting in Afghanistan,\" he said. \"This is America's war. It's not Obama's war.\" The GOP chairman is known for off-the-cuff and occasionally troublesome comments, but the Afghanistan remarks were too much to bear for some war-supporting Republicans. DeMint, who said Afghanistan is a war the United States must win, said Steele needs to \"refocus\" on the November election. He called Steele's comments \"unacceptable\" and \"inaccurate.\" \"We need a chairman who's focused,\" DeMint said. Speaking on ABC's \"This Week,\" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Steele's comments were \"wildly inaccurate.\" The Arizona Republican said Steele needs to assess whether he can still function in his job and must make \"an appropriate decision\" about his future. Trying to quell the furor, Steele issued a statement saying: \"There is no question that America must win the war on terror. ... And, for the sake of the security of the free world, our country must give our troops the support necessary to win this war.\" He sent an e-mail to RNC members saying he hoped his statement would \"clear up any confusion\" caused by his earlier remarks. That didn't seem to quiet the controversy in the slightest. Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, who led the charge of conservatives calling for Steele to step down over the remark, said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that Steele still needs to go -- though he said Steele tried to convince him otherwise. \"I think it would be better if he went,\" he said.",

Let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!\u201d he said at the end of a lengthy post on Twitter. Both Facebook and Twitter have been under fire for allegedly censoring accounts, while ignoring rules violations by liberal and left-wing users.  Trump in the past has referred to alleged \u201cshadow banning\u201d by Twitter as \u201cdiscriminatory and illegal.\u201d Trump uses Twitter on a daily basis, and his campaign was credited for its use of Facebook as one of the ways it secured its victory in November 2016. While conservatives have complained for years about what they say is discrimination by the tech giants, the controversy escalated last month when Vice News reported the issue, saying that accounts from top Republicans including GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel were being given limited visibility on Twitter.  Twitter at the time said it was an algorithmic glitch that has since been fixed. \"We do not shadow ban.  You are always able to see the tweets from accounts you follow (although you may have to do more work to find them, like go directly to their profile).  And we certainly don\u2019t shadow ban based on political viewpoints or ideology,\" the tech giant said in a statement. \"We do rank tweets and search results.  We do this because Twitter is most useful when it\u2019s immediately relevant.  These ranking models take many signals into consideration to best organize tweets for timely relevance,\" the statement said.  \"We must also address bad-faith actors who intend to manipulate or detract from healthy conversation.\" A Facebook executive apologized last month for mistreating Diamond and Silk -- two pro-Trump personalities who have long claimed they are being censored by the platform, but the company has also denied being biased against conservatives. \u201cWe badly mishandled our communications with them,\u201d Monika Bickert, head of Global Policy Management at Facebook, said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. But that has done little to calm the controversy, and Trump on Saturday accused social media sites of \u201cclosing down the opinions of many people on the right, while at the same time doing nothing to others.\u201d \"Too many voices are being destroyed, some good & some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen,\" he tweeted. He went on to call censorship \u201ca dangerous thing\u201d and then took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, saying that while they are \u201cfake,\u201d he does not demand that offending content be taken off air. \u201cIf you are weeding out Fake News, there is nothing so Fake as CNN & MSNBC, & yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed,\u201d he tweeted.  \u201cI get used to it and watch with a grain of salt, or don\u2019t watch at all..\u201d ",

        "body": " Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned Wednesday that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession. \"To pass this bill in the next couple of weeks would materially increase the risk that the economy would stall out and we would have a double dip,\" he told reporters at the White House. Summers added that he thinks Congress will pass the deal President Obama struck with Republicans, an agreement that has come under withering criticism from liberal Democrats over the two-year extension of tax cuts for the rich as well as the middle class. Summers said that he doesn't think that Congress would take a step that \"materially increases the risk that this economy will stall out.\" Positive reviews coming in from economists, Summers said, show the deal is the right thing to do. Sen. Jon Kyl, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, told reporters that a tax cut bill could be on the Senate floor as early as Thursday. But, in a surprise move, Senate Democrats, meeting behind closed doors to discuss the tax deal, have asked the administration for \"changes\" to the bill, according to Sen Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber. Durbin would not detail what those changes are, deferring to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. Kyl said an official analysis and price tag, referred to as a \"score,\" from the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) are not yet ready, but that the Senate could move to the bill anyway. Vice President Biden traveled to the Capitol Wednesday for a private meeting with House Democrats who are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy. Some Democrats are unhappy that Obama agreed to extend expiring tax cuts not just for the middle class but also for higher earners, and that he agreed to impose a lower estate tax on wealthy heirs. Both provisions are seen by many Democrats as giveaways to the rich that will do little to help the economy. In return, Democrats would get extended jobless benefits for people who have been unemployed for long stretches. Workers would also see their share of Social Security payroll taxes cut by nearly a third for the coming year, a boost in take-home pay meant to encourage spending and aid the economy. Liberals are going as far as trying to prevent outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from bringing the tax cut compromise to the floor. Reps. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, and Jim McDermott and Jay Inslee of Washington state are crafting a letter to share with the House Democratic Caucus that would try to block the bill from seeing the light of day. They're hoping to get 60 signatures on their letter and then force a vote in the caucus. \"There does not seem to be a majority of the Democrats who support the deal negotiated by Vice President Biden,\" he told Fox News. \"So we want to have a record vote in the caucus on a resolution that says this resolution should not go to the floor without a majority of Democratic votes.\" DeFazio said House Democrats aren't going to keep rubber-stamping deals they don't like. \"All through this administration, the White House has been a spear carrier for the president,\" he said. \"They sent something over, the speaker has jammed it through and then Obama has negotiated with the Senate. And they're trying to get us to jam it through again. And a number of us are just saying that's enough.\" Obama rejected claims that he betrayed Democrats by cutting a deal with Republicans. Speaking to reporters at a joint appearance with Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski, Obama said economists predict higher job growth in 2011 and 2012 if Congress passes the agreement and urged lawmakers to examine the details of the deal and \"get this done.\" But House Democrats are not listening. \"So far, the response has not been very good,\" Pelosi said. She called the estate tax provision \"a bridge too far.\"",

Trump infamously bragged about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d in a leaked tape from 2005; since taking office he has referred to certain other nations as \u201cshithole countries\u201d and slung insults at a wide range of political foes.

Any controversy over Tlaib\u2019s comment concerns the \u201cfreedom of speech of an individual member,\u201d not the stance of the Democratic caucus, Pelosi said.

Liberal groups, which are deeply skeptical whether Republicans will keep their word after years of inaction on codifying protections for the undocumented young people often called Dreamers, angrily slammed Democrats \u2015 and in particular Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) \u2015 for giving away leverage with no firm promise that an immigration bill would reach President Donald Trump\u2019s desk. \u201cIt\u2019s official: Chuck Schumer is the worst negotiator in Washington \u2015 even worse than Trump. Any plan to protect Dreamers that relies on the word of serial liars like Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan or Donald Trump is doomed to fail,\u201d CREDO Political Director Murshed Zaheed said in a statement. CREDO Action, the activist arm of the wireless phone company, advocates for progressive causes, including immigrants rights and the passage of legislation that would give Dreamers a pathway to citizenship. MoveOn.org, one of the most influential progressive organizations in Washington, similarly panned the agreement that 33 Senate Democrats voted to advance to a final vote on Monday. \u201cThis is a bad, outrageous deal. Trump and Republicans in Congress stood with their anti-immigrant nativist base, and too many Democrats backed down, abandoned Dreamers, and failed to fight for their values,\u201d MoveOn.org Political Action Executive Director Ilya Sheyman said in a statement. McConnell said over the weekend that he intends to move to vote on an immigration bill if both parties can\u2019t agree to one by Feb. 8, as long as the government is still fully open. The admission left some Senate Democrats encouraged by the prospect of a bipartisan solution \u2015 even if they have no guarantee from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that it will pass in the House. \u201cI believe Sen. McConnell will follow through,\u201d independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, told reporters on Monday. \u201cI think he\u2019s made his commitments so publicly and so unequivocally.\u201d Other Democrats, such as Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), remained unconvinced that McConnell and the House Republicans would follow through on immigration. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he made any commitment whatsoever and I think it would be foolhardy to believe that he made a commitment,\u201d Harris said. While Senate Democrats did not receive everything they asked for in exchange for voting to reopen the government, they did manage to get the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program funded for six years. And if McConnell doesn\u2019t follow through on immigration, Democrats will still be able to use his promise to vote against the next spending bill on Feb. 8 and pin the blame on Republicans. For now, though, Democrats who voted to reopen the government said that simply pushing the conversation in the right direction was a victory on its own. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can guarantee a House outcome but I think the stronger the bill, in terms of the strength of the bipartisanship in the bill \u2015 the odds go up in the House,\u201d Sen.

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The tableau at the White House was chillingly familiar: The somber president, nearing the end of his eight-year term, walked grim-faced to the podium to offer his condolences, promised action in the wake of suffering and pleaded for a new resolve that just might prevent more deaths in a hail of bullets. The list of tragedies on President Obama\u2019s watch seems countless by now. An elementary classroom. A church. A military base. A movie theater. And, now, a gay nightclub. Mr. Obama said Sunday\u2019s massacre, by a gunman with a handgun and an assault weapon, is another brutal reminder of how easy it is for someone to slaughter dozens. \u201cWe have to decide if that\u2019s the kind of country we want to be,\u201d Mr. Obama said on Sunday as he mourned the nation\u2019s deadliest mass shooting. \u201cAnd to actively do nothing is a decision, as well.\u201d Mr. Obama vowed to respond forcefully to what he called a devastating \u201cact of terror and an act of hate.\u201d This time, it was a tragedy that combined gun violence, a hatred of gays and ties to Islamist terrorism. In his remarks, Mr. Obama said it was still unclear to the authorities whether there was a direct link between the gunman and international terrorist groups. But in the hours after he spoke, law enforcement officials said that the gunman had pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State, and they acknowledged that he had twice been investigated for terrorism connections. It took only hours for questions about those connections to become fodder in the presidential campaign. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, seized on the attacks as evidence of America\u2019s weakness in facing terrorism. He demanded that Mr. Obama resign because he refused to say the words \u201cradical Islam\u201d in his remarks. \u201cIf we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement. \u201cBecause our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen \u2014 and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack.\u201d Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, called the massacre in Orlando, Fla., an \u201cact of terror\u201d and an \u201cact of hate\u201d and called for \u201chardening our defenses at home\u201d while \u201crefusing to be intimidated and staying true to our values\u201d in the United States. Mr. Obama pleaded with Americans during his remarks not to \u201cgive in to fear or turn against each other,\u201d a somewhat muted reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s previous call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. \u201cIn the face of hate and violence, we will love one another,\u201d Mr. Obama said. Rather than giving in to fear, the president said, \u201cwe will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people, and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.\u201d Speaking to reporters, Mr. Obama said the country had again been traumatized by grievous violence, which shattered more than 100 lives during a three-hour nightmare early Sunday, with 50 people killed and 53 wounded in the attack. During his presidency, Mr. Obama has repeatedly mourned victims of mass shootings, often expressing anger and frustration at what he has said is the country\u2019s apparent willingness to let them become a \u201cnormal\u201d part of life. That anger has been compounded by Mr. Obama\u2019s inability to persuade lawmakers to impose new restrictions on the availability of firearms, especially the assault-style rifles like the one believed to have been used by the gunman in Sunday morning\u2019s attack in Orlando. A major push for a ban on assault weapons after the 2012 massacre of schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., ended in failure. \u201cCan we say that we\u2019re truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose?\u201d an emotional Mr. Obama said after the Newtown attack. Mr. Obama on Sunday gave his deepest condolences to the families of the victims, and he said Americans should, in particular, keep the country\u2019s gay and lesbian community in mind as they offer their prayers. He called it an \u201cespecially heartbreaking day\u201d for the gay community. \u201cThe shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThe place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub \u2014 it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds and to advocate for their civil rights.\u201d Mr. Obama has often hailed the progress on gay rights that has been made during his presidency, especially the decision by the United States Supreme Court to allow same-sex marriage. But those legal protections have not erased hatred in the country. \u201cThis is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American \u2014 regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation \u2014 is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country,\u201d he said. Mr. Obama took no questions from reporters after delivering his five-minute remarks. He turned from the podium to walk back into the West Wing, once again left to monitor the investigation, prepare a likely eulogy for the dead and wonder when he might have to come into the briefing room again. Shortly after he spoke, Mr. Obama ordered that flags at the White House and other federal sites around the world be lowered to half-staff. Again.",

This is a very tender and sensitive topic, as are many social issues, but I have the same view that I've had since running for office.\" Obama came out in support of same-sex marriage on Wednesday in an interview with ABC. The announcement prompted a flurry of responses, from Democrats praising his statements to Republicans decrying them. Romney said he supports states' rights to make decisions on domestic partnership benefits, including hospital visitation. Obama, while saying he personally supports same-sex marriage, also said the issue should be left to the states to decide. Romney's comments were far more measured than some other Republicans, who have openly accused the president of disrespecting religion and using the issue for political gain. Former GOP candidate Rick Santorum, for example, put out a statement shortly after Romney's remarks that claimed Obama \"has consistently fought against protecting the institution of marriage from radical social engineering at both the state and federal level.\" When asked whether Obama flip-flopped on same-sex marriage -- an accusation Romney has some experience with -- the presumptive Republican presidential nominee acknowledged the president's change, but said he'd leave the significance for others to decide. \u201cI believe that, based upon the interview he gave today on ABC, it said that he had changed his view, but you\u2019re a better judge of that than I am,\" Romney said. \u201cI just saw the reports that he had previously said he opposed same sex marriage and now, according to ABC News, he said that he supports it. So if that\u2019s the case you\u2019ll have to make that determination on your own.\" Romney told a local Denver TV station earlier on Wednesday that he opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions. \"Well, when these issues were raised in my state of Massachusetts, I indicated my view, which is I do not favor marriage between people of the same gender, and I do not favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name,\" Romney told Denver Fox affiliate KDVR-TV.",

        "body": " As Senate Democrats float new options for complicating a vote on President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Republicans appear ready to return fire with a bomb of their own \u2013 a nuclear one. Top Republican Sen. John Thune, of South Dakota, all but confirmed Wednesday that his party is willing to use what\u2019s known as the \u201cnuclear option,\u201d to lower the vote threshold to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch if Democrats try to filibuster. \u201cWe will do what is necessary to confirm Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, yes,\u201d he told Fox News\u2019 Shannon Bream on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom,\u201d when asked if they\u2019d go that route. Thune, who serves in the No. 3 position in Senate GOP leadership as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, added that Democrats \u201chave not laid a glove on him\u201d in the hearings and predicted the judge would get an \u201caffirmative\u201d vote in the Senate. The threat comes as Democrats not only threaten to filibuster but suggest he shouldn\u2019t get a vote until the FBI completes its probe of possible links between Russia and Trump associates. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., both called Tuesday for a postponement on any vote to confirm Gorsuch to the nation\u2019s highest court. \u201cIt is unseemly to be moving forward so fast on confirming a Supreme Court justice with a lifetime appointment while this big gray cloud of an FBI investigation hangs over the presidency,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cYou can bet if the shoe were on the other foot and a Democratic president was under investigation by the FBI the Republicans would be howling at the moon about filling a Supreme Court seat in such circumstances.\" Warren added on Twitter: \u201cNeil Gorsuch is up for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court from a President whose campaign is under FBI investigation.\u201d Republicans panned the call as \"ridiculous.\" But Democrats could still try and filibuster, requiring Gorsuch to garner 60 \u201cyea\u201d votes in the Senate. That's a high bar for Republicans, who have just 52 members in the Senate. That's where the so-called \"nuclear option\" comes in. If majority Republicans change the threshold, Gorsuch could be approved with a simple majority of 51 votes. The nuclear option was first used by Democrats for circuit court judicial appointments in 2013 and top Republicans \u2013 including President Trump \u2013 have indicated for weeks it\u2019s a serious option in order to get Gorsuch on the court. \u201cIf we end up with that gridlock, I would say, \u2018If you can, Mitch, go nuclear,'\u201d Trump said Feb. 1. Republican Senate leaders so far have refrained from using the term \u2013 but their exasperated rhetoric shows they\u2019re at least kicking the tires of a legislative Enola Gay. \u201cIf Judge Gorsuch can\u2019t achieve 60 votes in the Senate, could any judge appointed by a Republican president be approved with 60 or more votes in the Senate?\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., asked on Tuesday. \u201cIf they don\u2019t find Gorsuch acceptable, are they taking the position the vacancy should never be filled? At all?\u201d McConnell hasn\u2019t tipped his hand on strategy; however, he\u2019s maintained in interviews that, one way or another, \u201cthe nominee will be confirmed.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., meanwhile, lamented the increasing politicization of Supreme Court nominations and implored his Democratic colleagues to vote on the man \u2013 not the party of the president who nominated him. \u201cHere\u2019s what I hope \u2013 that we turn around and go back to where we were, because what we\u2019re doing is going to destroy the judiciary over time,\u201d Graham said on Monday. Supreme Court justices have faced more pushback from the opposition party in recent years. Antonin Scalia \u2013 whom Gorsuch would replace on the court following Scalia\u2019s death in 2016 \u2013 was confirmed 98-0 and Anthony Kennedy had a tally of 97-0 in 1988. But the contentious Clarence Thomas hearing in 1991 produced a 52-48 split that just pushed Thomas over the finish line. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed 96-3 two years later and \u201cyea\u201d votes have largely dwindled ever since: Stephen Breyer, 87; John Roberts, 78; Samuel Alito, 58; Sonia Sotomayor, 68; Elena Kagan, 63.",

        "body": " DES MOINES \u2013 Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday urged President Obama to listen to congressional Democrats \u2013 particular the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi \u2013 and make changes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that reflect their concerns about protecting American jobs and wages. In her first detailed comments on the trade deal since the House of Representatives refused on Friday to allow Mr. Obama to negotiate it freely, Mrs. Clinton laid out a far more calibrated position on the deal than many Democrats and Republicans have taken. She declined to take sides on the Friday vote itself but instead allied herself with Democratic critics of the deal \u2014 without actually opposing it. She argued that the House vote gave Mr. Obama \u201cthis amazing opportunity\u201d to seek concessions from Pacific trading partners to salvage the deal. \u201cThe president should listen to and work with his allies in Congress, starting with Nancy Pelosi, who have expressed their concerns about the impact that a weak agreement would have on our workers to make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a rally here. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t get it, there should be no deal,\u201d she added. Mrs. Clinton indicated that if she were president, she would not abandon the 12-nation Pacific trade deal \u2013 as some Democrats want \u2013 but would use the opposition in Congress as negotiating leverage. \u201cI am willing to try now to see whether you can push to get rid of the objectionable parts, to drive a harder bargain on some of the other parts,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at the rally, her first here as a candidate for the 2016 presidential nomination. Mrs. Clinton has been criticized by Republicans and some Democrats for saying little about the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal in recent weeks, especially since she had made favorable comments about it as secretary of state. She is facing many Democratic primary voters who have deep misgivings about trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, that President Bill Clinton signed, and she faces rivals for the 2016 nomination like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont who flatly oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A few hours before Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks, Mr. Sanders repeated his challenge to her to oppose the trade agreement. \u201cI would hope that the secretary joins Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown and the vast majority of Democrats in the Congress in saying, \u2018No, we have got to defeat this piece of legislation,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sanders said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d referring to fellow senators. Without naming names, Mrs. Clinton sought to distinguish herself from Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, as well as from fervent supporters of the deal like some of the Republicans running for president. \u201cNo president would be a tougher negotiator on behalf of American workers with either our trading partners or Republicans on Capitol Hill than I would be,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cThere are the voices that are for the deal no matter what\u2019s in it, and there are voices that are against the deal no matter what\u2019s in it. I kind of fall in the group that says, \u2018Let\u2019s find out what\u2019s in it, and let\u2019s make it as good as it can be before we make the decision.\u2019\u201d Mrs. Clinton invoked Ms. Pelosi\u2019s name twice during her remarks and appeared to agree with Ms. Pelosi that \u201cthere are some specifics in there that could and should be changed.\u201d She said she supported trade adjustment authority to protect American jobs, but otherwise did not delve into details. \u201cLet\u2019s take the lemons and turn it into lemonade,\u201d she said. Later on Sunday, at a house party with Democrats in Burlington, Iowa, Mrs. Clinton was more explicit in challenging Mr. Obama by setting expectations for him to work with congressional Democrats on the trade deal. Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Pelosi \u201cas strong a supporter\u201d as Mr. Obama has, and said she hoped Mr. Obama would \u201cseize\u201d the chance to work with Democrats to improve the trade pact. \u201cMy view is the White House should call Nancy and a few other of the Democrats to say, \u2018What would it take to get an agreement that would be better and not worse for American workers?\u2019\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, aligning herself with a potential future ally (Ms. Pelosi) over a lame-duck president. \u201cI have held my peace because I thought it was important for the Congress to have a full debate without thrusting presidential politics and candidates into it,\u201d Mrs. Clinton added. \u201cBut now I think the president and his team could have a chance to drive a harder bargain, because they are now in the position of saying to all of these other countries \u2018we need to maximize the number of winners.\u2019\u201d",

Trump from becoming president \u2014 and would work closely with Hillary Clinton to make that happen. After the meeting with Mr. Obama, which lasted more than an hour, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was ready to leave the race just yet, insisting that he would compete in next week\u2019s primary contest here in Washington. However, he made clear that party unity was on his mind. \u201cI will work as hard as I can, to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Sanders told reporters, saying the Manhattan businessman \u201cmakes bigotry and discrimination the cornerstone of his campaign\u201d and would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d as commander in chief. He said he would continue fighting for the issues that animated his campaign, including enhancing Social Security benefits, college affordability and restoring the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. \u201cThese are the issues that we will take to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, declining to answer reporters\u2019 shouted questions about whether he would leave the race. Shortly after their meeting, Mr. Obama endorsed Mrs. Clinton in a video. He also praised the campaign that Mr. Sanders ran. The visit came a day after the senator huddled with his team at his headquarters in Vermont to discuss the fate of his candidacy. Mr. Sanders, who requested the meeting with the president, pulled into the White House grounds at 10:56 a.m. after stopping at a nearby Peet\u2019s Coffee for a scone. Mr. Obama and Mr. Sanders strolled down the colonnade next to the Rose Garden on their way into the Oval Office, chatting inaudibly and grinning broadly. Nearby, a thick line of cameras and cluster of microphones were assembled in the driveway outside the West Wing, where journalists peppered the Vermont senator with questions. Mr. Obama was trying to negotiate, however gently, with him to exit the Democratic race without inflicting damage on efforts to unite the party. \u201cMy hope is, is that over the next couple of weeks, we\u2019re able to pull things together,\u201d Mr. Obama said during a taping of an appearance on the \u201cTonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d on Wednesday in New York. \u201cThere\u2019s a natural process of everybody recognizing that this is not about any individual.\u201d Briefly posing for photographers before his meeting in the Capitol with Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, Mr. Sanders ignored three questions about Mr. Obama\u2019s endorsement of Mrs. Clinton. His face flushed, Mr. Sanders did not speak at all. But Mr. Reid gently scolded the assembled journalists for asking questions at what was supposed to be just a photo opportunity. After his meeting with Reid, Mr. Sanders made a quick exit through a back hall on his way to meet with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. He was also scheduled to meet with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. After Mrs. Clinton won Tuesday\u2019s California primary, Mr. Sanders refused to quit the race, despite Mrs. Clinton\u2019s wide margin of victory and the fact that she had the support of enough delegates for the nomination. But some of his supporters have started to walk away, prompting growing calls that it is time to bring the party together to defeat Mr. Trump. On Wednesday, Mr. Sanders sent out a fund-raising email asking for contributions of $2.70, and at 7 p.m. he will hold a rally outside of R.F.K. Stadium in Washington, where he will discuss his plans for getting big money out of politics and making public universities tuition free.",

        "body": " Senate Democrats\u2019 Vote to End Shutdown Infuriates Some on the Left WASHINGTON \u2014 The decision by Senate Democrats to end the government shutdown on Monday in exchange for a promised immigration vote enraged liberals, who accused the lawmakers of betrayal and threatened to mount primaries against some of the Democrats who voted yes. Regardless of what happens in the Senate, progressive and immigrant advocacy groups said House Republican leaders will never take up a bill that would offer legal status to young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children without excruciating concessions on other immigration issues. They accused Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and moderate Democratic senators of capitulating to protect senators up for re-election in November in Republican-leaning states. \u201cThey blinked because they\u2019ll always put the party and the success of the party first,\u201d said Representative Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez of Illinois, one of the leading Democratic advocates for immigrants, complaining that Hispanics got short shrift. \u201cIt\u2019s the one word they know in Spanish: ma\u00f1ana.\u201d The hasty retreat by 33 Senate Democrats was particularly humiliating in the immediate aftermath of the anniversary of the Women\u2019s March, which saw thousands of activists reconvene in cities across the country to protest against President Trump and congressional Republicans. Liberal groups such as MoveOn.org began urging members to sign up on Monday for rallies aimed at pressuring Republicans to protect the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. By noon, their own ostensible allies in Congress had buckled. \u201cThe grass-roots are rightly furious with a slew of elected Democrats,\u201d said Ben Wikler, the Washington director of MoveOn.org. \u201cIn the Obama years, Republicans learned to be more afraid of primary challenges than general elections. But Democrats are still operating as though the Tea Party is more powerful than The Resistance.\u201d The anger on the left was reminiscent of conservative unrest that fueled primary race challenges against sitting Republican senators accused of appeasing an opposition president, Barack Obama, and his congressional allies. Mr. Schumer, determined to keep the fissures in his party coalition muted, used a meeting of Senate Democrats before the vote to urge the liberals in his caucus not to criticize those voting to reopen the government, according to one senator who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting. And for the most part, the liberal senators who opposed the agreement held their fire. Democrats have largely avoided the internal insurrections that upended Republicans over the past decade. Mr. Schumer is not a figure of derision on the left as Mr. McConnell is on the right. And Senate Democrats have crushed most primary election challenges easily. Senate leaders have intervened freely in a number of 2018 races \u2014 in states like Arizona and Tennessee \u2014 to anoint more moderate standard-bearers. Former Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said Democrats from the more rural states that make up much of the 2018 map would prefer to battle over issues other than immigration. The Obama-era program that protected young undocumented immigrants \u2014 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA \u2014 is an important issue, he said, but \u201cit isn\u2019t the bread and butter of successful Democrat politics.\u201d \u201cOur major issues are jobs, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, Social Security, infrastructure, supporting domestic programs, clean air, safe drinking water,\u201d Mr. Dorgan said, adding of his conservative-state brethren, \u201cWhile those Democrats do strongly support DACA, I\u2019m sure they would prefer to be discussing different issues.\u201d But the patience of the left may be running thin. By appearing to retreat on Monday, Democrats have stirred new talk on the left about challenging incumbents who had previously given little thought to their own nominations. Faiz Shakir, the political director of the American Civil Liberties Union and an adviser to former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said the group and its allies were actively exploring places to intervene in primary elections. Mr. Shakir said of some Democrats that it is an \u201copen question, still, whether they\u2019re going to fight for Dreamers.\u201d Right now, only one Democratic senator faces a serious primary challenge: Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who voted against the government-funding deal and complained privately that she and most of her colleagues had been asked to vote on Friday against a nearly identical measure to keep the government open. Ms. Feinstein has tacked to the left since Kevin de L\u00e9on, the president of the California State Senate, announced his challenge to her in October. Mr. de L\u00e9on said Monday that Democrats had made a grave mistake striking \u201canother fingers-crossed bargain with Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell.\u201d Mr. de L\u00e9on said he had called and left a voice mail message with Thomas E. Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, and planned to convey that Democrats had sent a terrible message to \u201cvoters of color and millennial voters who feel like they\u2019ve been abandoned.\u201d \u201cOnce again, the party\u2019s leaders in Washington have capitulated, compromised and redrawn a line in the sand even further away from justice,\u201d he said. One House Democrat is already under fire for not taking a stronger stance on behalf of immigrants: Representative Daniel Lipinski of Illinois, a moderate Democrat from Chicago who is facing a primary race challenger, Marie Newman, in March. \u201cI asked him to sign on to Dream bill. He said, \u2018I don\u2019t think I can do that,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez, whoendorsed Ms. Newman last week. (Mr. Lipinski opposed the measure in 2010 but has said in recent months that he would support it if it comes to the House floor.) The chances of a successful primary election challenge in the Senate are far more remote. Many of the Democrats facing re-election in November hail from states that Mr. Trump carried and are more concerned about well-funded Republican opponents than liberal challengers. Of the 10 Democrats who gathered outside the Senate chamber after the vote to crow about their bipartisan agreement, six are on the ballot this year. \u201cIf you want results, you have to compromise, and if you\u2019re unwilling to compromise, you won\u2019t get results,\u201d said Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota. \u201cYou maybe get a political issue, but you won\u2019t get results. And I didn\u2019t come here to do politics.\u201d Progressives, however, are already eyeing one of the Democrats who pushed for a compromise: Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. On a conference call convened Sunday night by liberal groups, there was notable anger toward Ms. Klobuchar, according to two participants. Ms. Klobuchar, however, illustrates why the Democratic base may find it difficult to inflict payback: She is broadly popular with liberals in Minnesota, and the shutdown fight has come late enough in the congressional calendar to leave any would-be challenger with little time to prepare. \u201cI have been working hard for the people of Minnesota, and I think the people of Minnesota understand that, including in my party,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said.",

She jousted with Republican lawmakers over who deserved blame for the security problems at the compound, and choked up as she described being at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington when the bodies of the Americans killed in the assault arrived from Libya. \u201cI stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews,\u201d she said. \u201cI put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters.\u201d The continuing controversy over the attack, which resulted in the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, has cast a cloud over Mrs. Clinton\u2019s final months at the State Department. It also has enormous political implications for Mrs. Clinton, the former New York senator who is already regarded as the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination if she chooses to run. It was the first time she had faced extensive questioning about her role in the episode. In essence, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s approach was to accept the responsibility for security lapses in Benghazi but not the blame. \u201cI feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the morning. \u201cBut the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didn\u2019t see those requests. They didn\u2019t come to me. I didn\u2019t approve them. I didn\u2019t deny them.\u201d When the question of her role was taken up again in the afternoon hearing by Representative Ed Royce, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she had been briefed on a series of events that indicated that security in Benghazi was deteriorating in the months before the attack. They included the placement of a bomb at the outer wall of the compound in June and an ambush that month on the British ambassador. But she said she had gone along with a recommendation from subordinates that the Benghazi post be kept open and assumed that they would take the necessary steps to protect it. Mrs. Clinton first publicly took responsibility for the Sept. 11 attack in an Oct. 15 interview with television reporters. Since then, she has committed herself to putting in place all of the recommendations of an independent review that was led by Thomas R. Pickering, a former American ambassador, and Mike Mullen, the retired admiral who served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. For all of the hours of testimony, the hearings did little to clarify the role of the White House in overseeing the American presence in Libya before the attack or explain why the Pentagon had few forces available on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to respond quickly to any assault on diplomatic outposts in the region. One of the sharpest exchanges of the day came when Mrs. Clinton responded to questions from Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, by saying there was too much focus on how the Benghazi attack had been characterized in its early hours and not enough on how to prevent a recurrence. Republicans have repeatedly charged that Obama administration officials deliberately played down the attack, focusing much of their criticism on Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations and once Mr. Obama\u2019s choice to succeed Mrs. Clinton. \u201cWas it because of a protest, or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they\u2019d go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, her voice rising. \u201cIt is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.\u201d Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, began his questions by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see you in good health and as combative as ever,\u201d and then proceeded to complain that she had failed to answer lingering questions. Mr. McCain asserted that the Obama administration\u2019s aversion to nation-building had precluded it from providing the kind of training and assistance that would have helped the fledgling Libyan government in Tripoli confront growing security threats from militants. \u201cWe did not give them the kind of assistance that would have been necessary to help dismantle these militias that still, to this day, remain a challenge to democracy in Libya,\u201d he said. Mrs. Clinton responded that Congress had delayed aid to Libya and said she would provide a list of steps that had been taken to train and equip Libyan forces. A persistent line of questioning by Republican lawmakers concerned the initial comments from Ms. Rice that the attack might have resulted from a protest, over an anti-Islamic video, that spun out of control. Mrs. Clinton defended Ms. Rice even as she appeared to distance herself from Ms. Rice\u2019s comments. \u201cI told the American people that heavily armed militants assaulted our compound, and I vowed to bring them to justice,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s chairman, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, has been nominated to succeed Mrs. Clinton and is scheduled to appear before his committee on Thursday for a confirmation hearing. To avoid the perception of a conflict of interest, the hearing on Wednesday was led by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, the incoming chairman, and Mr. Kerry did not attend. In a rare criticism of the committee by one of its members, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the ranking Republican, complained that the panel Mr. Kerry led had failed to conduct proper oversight of security and other State Department issues. \u201cThis is an opportunity for this committee to finally do the work that it should have been doing for years,\u201d Mr. Corker said. Mrs. Clinton sought to put the events in Benghazi in a regional context, noting the presence of a group in northern Mali affiliated with Al Qaeda. \u201cBenghazi didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Arab revolutions have scrambled power dynamics and shattered security forces across the region. And instability in Mali has created an expanding safe haven for terrorists who look to extend their influence and plot further attacks of the kind we saw just last week in Algeria.\u201d \u201cWe are in for a struggle, but it is a necessary struggle,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe haven.\u201d",

Braley apologized for the remarks in a written statement after the video was released. He said he \u201crespects\u201d Grassley and proclaimed his support for Iowa\u2019s farmers. \u201cI have tremendous respect for Iowa farmers and appreciate how important they are to our state, and I\u2019m grateful to have the support of hundreds of farmers across Iowa,\u201d he said.

        "body": " In a head-to-head battle of proxies, Vice President Biden wasted no time Thursday trying to do what many Democrats felt President Obama failed to against Mitt Romney, going on offense with an often disdainful attack on Paul Ryan -- who stood his ground against a barrage of Biden grins, guffaws, snickers and interruptions. The dueling running mates turned the lone vice presidential debate into an uncharacteristically feisty affair, scrapping over everything from the economy to Libya to taxes. But it was the vice president who set the aggressive tone, blatantly striving to hit the reset after President Obama was panned for his lackluster performance at last week's opening debate. If Obama was too cold, Biden at times bordered on too hot, analysts said afterward. He chuckled and smirked through many of Ryan's responses. But unlike Obama a week ago, he let few points go unchallenged. Biden went after the Romney/Ryan ticket with a directness that Obama did not. Notably, he hammered Mitt Romney over his secretly videotaped comment in which he said he doesn't have to worry about the \"47 percent\" of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes. \"These people are my mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors,\" Biden said, adding he's \"had it up to here\" with those kinds of comments. Ryan shot back, in reference to Biden's tendency to make gaffes: \"As the vice president very well knows ... sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way.\" \"But I always say what I mean,\" Biden responded. Ryan accused Obama of \"projecting weakness\" with his foreign policy, particularly in his response to the terror attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. At home, he accused the administration of presiding over a shoddy recovery. \"This is not what a real recovery looks like,\" Ryan said. Whether the debate will alter the course of the race remains to be seen. There are two more presidential debates on the calendar, and the polls have started to swing in Romney's favor. The tightening was reflected in the candidates' attitude onstage Thursday, each loath to give the other too many seconds of speech-time without a challenge. The economy, the budget deficit and foreign policy were central. Each candidate made frequent appeals to the middle class, Biden by pledging to protect programs in the federal budget and Ryan by pledging to grow the economy for everybody. Ryan opened the debate with tough criticism of the Obama administration over its handling of the Libya terror attack. \"What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy,\" Ryan said. With the moderator, ABC News' Martha Raddatz, opening the debate with a question about the Libya strike, which happened a month ago Thursday, Ryan criticized the administration for waiting more than a week after the strike to call it a coordinated terror attack. \"This is becoming more troubling by the day. They first blamed the YouTube video. Now they're trying to blame the Romney/Ryan ticket for making this an issue,\" he said. Ryan was referring to a claim by an Obama aide earlier Thursday that the only reason the attack had entered the political debate was because of Romney's criticism - a claim Romney rejected. Biden was quick to retort: \"With all due respect, that's just a bunch of malarkey. ... Not a single thing he said is accurate.\" He added: \"This talk about this weakness, I don't understand what my friend's talking about.\" Biden also criticized Romney for making a \"political statement\"on the night of the attack, a reference to Romney's criticism of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo's early response to protests there. On the question of why the administration initially claimed the attack was the result of a protest, Biden explained \"the intelligence community told us that.\" The face-off Thursday night was taking on outsized importance for a vice presidential debate. After Obama's debate performance last week, the pressure was on Biden to recapture the momentum -- while equally on Ryan to prevent the Obama ticket from blunting Romney's surge. Ryan referred to the weight on Biden's shoulders about mid-way through, as the two talked over each other on Medicare. \"Mr. vice president, I know you're under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if we don't keep interrupting each other,\" Ryan said. On Medicare, Biden charged that the Republican ticket's plan would raise costs for future seniors with a de facto \"voucher\" system. \"Their ideas are old and their ideas are bad and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare,\" he said. Ryan shot back: \"They got caught with their hand in the cookie jar turning Medicare into a piggy bank for ObamaCare.\" The debate veered across the spectrum of topics from the campaign trail. On Iran's nuclear program, Biden repeatedly suggested Romney and Ryan would too readily choose the military option to stop it. On abortion, he cautioned that the next president will get to choose one or two justices on the Supreme Court -- \"that's how close Roe v. Wade is.\" Ryan, toward the end of the debate, warned that a \"debt crisis is coming\" and claimed the sitting president offers little more than speeches to address the deficit. \"That's what we get in this administration -- speeches. But we're not getting leadership,\" he said. In a matter of days, Romney has picked up steam in both battleground and national polls. The latest Fox News national poll of likely voters showed Romney edging Obama, 46 percent to 45 percent. Obama has acknowledged he had a \"bad night\" in his debate last week, but the campaign indicates it will be more aggressive going forward. After Biden's more feisty performance Thursday, Obama campaign manager Jim Messina quipped that he's a \"happy warrior\" for the middle class. The final presidential debates will be held Oct. 16 and Oct. 22. The next one will be a town hall format focusing on a range of issues, and the last one will focus exclusively on foreign policy.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 In one of the most stunning primary election upsets in congressional history, the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, was soundly defeated on Tuesday by a Tea Party-backed economics professor who had hammered him for being insufficiently conservative. The result delivered a major jolt to the Republican Party \u2014 Mr. Cantor had widely been considered the top candidate to succeed Speaker John A. Boehner \u2014 and it has the potential to change both the debate in Washington on immigration and, possibly, the midterm elections. With just over $200,000, David Brat, a professor at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Va., toppled Mr. Cantor, repeatedly criticizing him for being soft on immigration and contending that he supported what critics call amnesty for immigrants in the country illegally. During a short concession speech late Tuesday, Mr. Cantor did not try to analyze his defeat or cast blame, saying only that he knew he had disappointed his supporters. In victory, Mr. Brat said that his candidacy had resonated with voters who believed that politics had been dumbed down by partisan infighting. \u201cThe American people want to pay attention to serious ideas again,\u201d Mr. Brat said, speaking on Fox News. \u201cOur founding was built by people who were political philosophers, and we need to get back to that, away from this kind of cheap political rhetoric of right and left.\u201d He will face Jack Trammell, a Democrat who is also a professor at Randolph-Macon, this fall in the heavily Republican district. Republicans were so sure that Mr. Cantor would win that most party leaders had been watching for how broad his victory would be. His defeat will reverberate in the capital and could have major implications for any chance of an immigration overhaul. Mr. Cantor, 51, who is in his seventh term, had sought to counter Mr. Brat\u2019s accusations that he was too willing to compromise on immigration. The majority leader, who had raised $5.4 million for the campaign, blanketed Virginia\u2019s Seventh Congressional District with fliers and television advertisements in which he emphasized that he opposed an \u201camnesty\u201d policy. But with significant help from conservative talk radio hosts like Laura Ingraham, Mr. Brat was able to galvanize opposition to Mr. Cantor in one of Virginia\u2019s most conservative congressional districts. Ms. Ingraham, one of the few high-profile conservatives to put her muscle behind Mr. Brat, said on Fox News on Tuesday night that the primary results were \u201can absolute repudiation of establishment politics\u201d and that Republican leaders should take note. \u201cHe really just didn\u2019t have very much money, but what he did have was a lot of heart,\u201d she said of Mr. Brat. \u201cI think there will be a lot of people out there saying this could be the beginning of something really big for the Republican Party.\u201d Mr. Cantor\u2019s loss recalled the defeat of former Speaker Thomas S. Foley, a Democrat who lost to a little-known Republican, George Nethercutt, in the 1994 general elections that delivered control of Congress to the Republicans. It is much rarer for a member of the congressional leadership to lose a primary. Mr. Brat had little help from national groups that have funded other Tea Party challengers. Instead, he relied mostly on state and local activists. Larry Nordvig, executive director of the Richmond Tea Party, said the national groups were not aware of \u201chow much activity was going on underneath the surface down here and how large the ABC \u2014 Anybody But Cantor \u2014 mentality was.\u201d In a February interview, Mr. Brat spoke of the difficulty he had in rounding up conservative support despite meeting with powerful groups and donors to try to convince them that he was worth the investment. \u201cI met with all of them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s tough. Everybody just wants to see the polls, how much money you\u2019ve raised. But they do not know what\u2019s going on on the ground.\u201d Mr. Cantor had won primaries in his district, which stretches from Richmond to the Washington suburbs, with as much as 79 percent of the vote, and he won the general election race for a seventh term in 2012 with 58 percent. Within the Republican Party, he was seen as a star, with the ability to tap into the energy of the House\u2019s more conservative members while at the same time not alienating the party\u2019s establishment wing. In the House, his relationship with Mr. Boehner reflected some of the larger tensions within the party. Mr. Cantor was strongly opposed, for instance, to the so-called grand bargain negotiations on the budget between the speaker and President Obama. Mr. Boehner said Tuesday that he and Mr. Cantor had \u201cbeen through a lot together,\u201d making \u201ctough choices that come with governing.\u201d Mr. Cantor received what amounted to a warning shot from local Republicans at a district convention last month in Henrico County, his political home base, when conservatives ousted one of his loyalists as Republican chairman while he looked on. Yet he seemed to recognize the seriousness of the threat only in the final weeks of the campaign, when he suddenly shifted his advertising and began sending aides from Washington to his district. At that point, it was too late to stave off defeat. \u201cThere are some very angry people upset with the status quo, and Eric became part of that,\u201d said former Representative Thomas M. Davis III, a Virginia Republican. \u201cHe was the only conduit they have to express their anger right now. And when Eric Cantor, a conservative and member of the leadership, is too moderate, it sends a chilling effect to other Republicans and makes it that much harder to cross over and work together.\u201d As for the prospects of an immigration overhaul now, Mr. Davis said: \u201cHow do you get that or anything done now? Eric is too liberal? This was the guy holding Boehner back.\u201d Many voters also perceived Mr. Cantor as ignoring district concerns as he sought to raise his national profile. He kept a home in suburban Richmond and sent his children to school there, but he spent much of his time in recent years traveling across the country to raise money and campaign for Republican candidates. It was all part of his ambition to become speaker of the House, having begun his career as the driver to his predecessor, Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr. Reaching that pinnacle had, of late, seemed as close as ever, with Washington full of speculation that Mr. Boehner would soon retire. \u201cI\u2019m in shock,\u201d said Representative Patrick T. McHenry, Republican of North Carolina. Congressional Democrats were ecstatic, and so stunned by Mr. Cantor\u2019s loss that many admitted they did not even know who the Democratic challenger was. An informal dinner party at the Georgetown apartment of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, turned into a celebration. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day that Eric Cantor would be losing his primary,\u201d said Representative Louise M. Slaughter of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Rules Committee. Ms. Pelosi said, \u201cI still can\u2019t even believe it.\u201d",

Trump, returning to Washington after spending the holidays at his Florida resort, posted an early-morning tweet lashing out at former Clinton aide Huma Abedin, apparently in response to Abedin emails released by the State Department on Friday. The emails, disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the conservative group Judicial Watch, were uncovered during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to Politico, part of the FBI\u2019s probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Abedin reportedly forwarded State Department emails, including some that contained passwords, to a personal account. Trump and his right-wing allies continue to raise the issue. Trump also said in his tweet that the Justice Department must act on \u201cComey and others,\u201d a reference to former FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election until Trump fired him in May. Trump, in tweets and interviews, has repeatedly sought to undermine his Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified. He has criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions numerous times for recusing himself from supervising the Russia investigation, and claims to have the right to direct government investigations himself.

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, campaigning in San Francisco on Sunday, told the large crowd that, \u201cI don't want a summary of the report! I want the whole damn report because nobody, especially this president, is above the law.\u201d And on Saturday, one day before Attorney General William Barr released a short summary of Mueller\u2019s findings, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke charged on the campaign trail in South Carolina that you \u201chave a president, who in my opinion beyond the shadow of a doubt, sought to, however ham-handedly, collude with the Russian government \u2015 a foreign power \u2015 to undermine and influence our elections.\u201d He did not comment at length on Sunday, but did say at a campaign stop in Las Vegas that Trump is \u201cone of the most racist and uncivil presidents we have ever had.\u201d Mueller\u2019s nearly two-year-long investigation did not establish that members of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government to interfere in the election in favor of Trump and at the expense of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Mueller\u2019s long-awaited findings also did not take a clear position on whether Trump obstructed justice, with no conclusions that the president committed a crime but also not exonerating Trump. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Sunday concluded, though, that Mueller\u2019s report did not contain sufficient evidence to establish that Trump committed obstruction of justice. America Rising, a pro-Republican opposition research group, took aim at O\u2019Rourke, saying on Sunday after Barr\u2019s announcement that the candidate made \u201cbrazen and incorrect claims on the campaign trail.\u201d Barr is expected to make public more of the report, but 2020 Democrats are demanding the full report be released. \u201cThe Mueller report needs to be made public, the underlying investigative materials should be handed over to Congress, and Barr must testify. That is what transparency looks like. A short letter from Trump's hand-picked Attorney General is not sufficient,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris of California wrote on Twitter Sunday. Rourke demanded Barr \u201crelease the full Mueller report to the American people and their representatives.\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts pointed to a recent unanimous vote by Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives to urge the release of the report. \u201cCongress didn\u2019t ask for a 'summary,' Attorney General Barr. Members of the House voted 420-0 to release the report. The American people deserve to see the full report. #ReleaseTheFullReport,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey wrote that the \u201cAmerican public deserves the full report and findings from the Mueller investigation immediately\u2014not just the in-house summary from a Trump Administration official.\u201d It was a similar call from Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who tweeted that \u201cAG Barr's summary 4-pg letter of Special Counsel Mueller's investigation underscores that the ENTIRE report & documentation-including all information re Russia\u2019s attempts to influence our election-need to be made public.

John Delaney of Maryland called for the report to be made public, but also urged that it was time to move on.

The four-term New York senator and the dozens of other Democrats who initially voted Friday to block the spending bill had been lauded by their progressive base even as nearly 1 million federal workers were furloughed without pay. \u201cLet the Senate know we stand with them for the Dreamers \u2026 say THANKS! to @SenSchumer and your own senator, and to urge them to stay strong,\u201d tweeted the Brooklyn, N.Y., chapter of Indivisible Nation, a leader in the progressive, Resist Trump movement. Yet by the time Schumer said Monday afternoon on the Senate floor that Democrats would soon vote in support of ending the shutdown, in exchange for Republicans\u2019 commitment to promptly craft and vote on legislation to help DREAMers, Schumer\u2019s support had turned. He suddenly faced calls to rally outside his Brooklyn apartment and suggestions that his leadership position was no longer secure. \u201cThis deal was morally reprehensible and political malpractice. It\u2019s Senator Schumer\u2019s job to keep the caucus together and fight for progressive values. He failed in that today,\u201d said Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin. \u201cThe big blue wave that Schumer hopes will make him Senate majority leader in 2019 will not build itself.\u201d Democracy for America, the political action committee founded by former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean, also said: \"If you want to know why we lost in 2016 and why a Democratic wave in 2018 is far from guaranteed \u2026 look no further than this weak and profoundly disappointing cave from Senate Democrats.\u201d Members of the \u201cNo, DREAM, No Deal\u201d began stepping up their calls for Schumer and others to \u201cstand strong\u201d Sunday night, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested a compromise had been reached, without offering any solid commitment. \u201cWhen the Democrat filibuster of the government funding bill ends, the serious, bipartisan negotiations that have been going on for months now to resolve our unfinished business -- military spending; disaster relief; healthcare; immigration and border security -- will continue,\u201d he said. \u201cAssuming that the government remains open, it would be my intention to proceed to legislation that would address DACA.\u201d Schumer, near the time of his announcement Monday, pledged his continued support for DREAMers, tweeting: \u201cSoon, the govt will reopen, and we have a lot to do: #ProtectDreamers. Write a budget, Address health care, veterans, disaster relief, pensions & the opioid epidemic. The #TrumpShutdown will soon end, but the work goes on.\u201d But by the time Republicans had the 60-plus votes, with support from 33 Democrats, the revolt was in full force. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d said Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy and campaigns at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cWe cannot rely on empty promises from those who have already proven to play politics with the lives of Dreamers. \u2026 Let it be known -- we will be watching, and will make sure voters this November know if their representatives stood for Dreamers or for their deportations.\u201d The short-term deal now only gives Congress until Feb. 8 to work out longer-term legislation, and an agreement on immigration. Trump tweeted Tuesday he's not sure it will happen. \"Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans & Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8, but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer!\" he said.",

Mary Cheney, one of ex-Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s two daughters, has taken to Facebook to blast her older sibling, Elizabeth, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for the latter\u2019s stance on same-sex marriage, The New York Times is reporting. Mary Cheney, openly lesbian and married to Heather Poe since 2012, reportedly posted to her personal page on the social media site: \u201cFor the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage. \u201cFreedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all families \u2014 regardless of how they look or how they are made \u2014 all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other.\u201d The Times reports Liz Cheney on Friday first articulated her position on the controversial subject, saying it should be something for voters to decide on a state-by-state basis, and not a matter for \u201cjudges\u201d or \u201clegislators.\u201d \u201cI am not pro-gay marriage,\u201d Liz Cheney reportedly said. \u201cI believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states, and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.\u201d Her sister replied by pulling no punches. \u201cIt\u2019s not something to be decided by a show of hands,\u201d Mary Cheney reportedly wrote on her personal Facebook page, concluding her internecine post by saying, \u201cPlease like and share if you agree.\u201d Elizabeth Cheney declared in July she plans to challenge incumbent Senator Mike Enzi, also a Republican, in the state\u2019s Republican primary. The election is slated for 2014. Former Vice President Cheney has publicly voiced support for same-sex marriage and, mirroring Elizabeth\u2019s stance, has reportedly said the matter should be decided on a state-by-state basis.",

Delegates at the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People approved the measure Tuesday in Kansas City. Benjamin Todd Jealous, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., said the resolution was not an attempt to label the entire Tea Party movement as racist. But he said the groups needed to do more to distance themselves from known hate groups that actively encourage their members to join the Tea Party. \u201cTo this point, we have avoided calling them out and demanding them to be responsible,\u201d Mr. Jealous said. \u201cNow we\u2019re saying that with increased public attention, increased power, comes the responsibility to act responsibly.\u201d He added: \u201cKnowing that the consequence of silence is violence in these times, we\u2019re saying stand up and say enough is enough. They need to make clear that there is no place for the bigots in the Tea Party movement.\u201d The resolution did not go over well with Tea Party groups and their supporters.

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The House Intelligence Committee will issue subpoenas to Michael T. Flynn, President Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, the committee\u2019s senior Democrat said on Wednesday, escalating Mr. Flynn\u2019s troubles with Congress. The Democrat, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said Mr. Flynn had declined the panel\u2019s request for documents and an interview as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in last year\u2019s election. \u201cThose subpoenas will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,\u201d Mr. Schiff told reporters during a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor. \u201cAnd I think we need to use whatever compulsory methods are necessary to get the information that he possesses.\u201d Mr. Schiff said he hoped the committee would issue the subpoenas this week, before Congress leaves for a one-week recess. It was unclear whether the subpoenas would seek documents or Mr. Flynn\u2019s testimony, or both. The subpoenas could not be issued without at least some support from Republicans, who make up the majority of the committee. A spokeswoman for Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, the Republican leading the investigation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Conaway has repeatedly refused to comment on the details of the investigation while it is continuing. The announcement was made mere hours after the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas Tuesday afternoon to Mr. Flynn\u2019s two firms, seeking information that could shed light on his lobbying work on behalf of Turkish interests last year, among other connections. On Monday, Mr. Flynn, in a letter from his legal team, rejected a subpoena for documents from the Senate committee, citing the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protections against self-incrimination. He also declined the Senate committee\u2019s invitation for an interview. Mr. Flynn\u2019s rejection of the subpoena put him at risk of being held in contempt of Congress, a rarely invoked process that, should lawmakers choose to pursue it, could result in a criminal citation. The Flynn Intel Group was paid more than $500,000 to represent Turkey in a dispute with the United States government while Mr. Flynn was advising the Trump campaign. He belatedly registered as a foreign agent for that work after being forced out of the Trump administration for misrepresenting his communications with the Russian ambassador to Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Flynn\u2019s legal troubles have only mounted in recent days. On Monday, it was revealed that he had misled Pentagon investigators about his foreign contacts and sources of income while seeking a renewed security clearance in February 2016. Among the payments he did not disclose was a $45,000 fee from a Russian state-backed news organization for a speech he gave in Moscow two months before. During that trip, he was photographed at a gala sitting next to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. Lying to federal officials is a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison. As recently as Monday, in his letter to the Senate committee, Mr. Flynn has reiterated his offer to testify in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the committee, has dismissed that option.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON\u2014Joining a chorus of Catholic bishops , theologians, priests, and social justice leaders, nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have called Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) to task for his misuse of Catholic social teaching in defending his budget, which hurts the poor. The group sent a letter to Rep. Ryan in advance of his appearance on the Catholic campus on Thursday morning to give the Whittington Lecture. In their letter to Ryan, the scholars make clear they are not objecting to his speaking on campus, but rather his recent comments defending his budget on Christian grounds. \u201cOur problem with Representative Ryan is that he claims his budget is based on Catholic social teaching,\u201d said Jesuit Father Thomas J. Reese , one of the organizers of the letter. \u201cThis is nonsense. As scholars, we want to join the Catholic bishops in pointing out that his budget has a devastating impact on programs for the poor.\u201d Reese is a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University. The letter quotes the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which wrote several letters to Congress saying \u201ca just framework for future budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to poor persons.\u201d The bishops noted that \u201cthe House-passed budget resolution fails to meet these moral criteria.\u201d Last week, Rep. Ryan dismissed the bishops\u2019 critique, erroneously claiming the letters didn\u2019t represent \u201call the bishops,\u201d a point the USCCB media office denied. \u201cI am afraid that Chairman Ryan\u2019s budget reflects the values of his favorite philosopher Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ,\u201d said Father Reese. \u201cSurvival of the fittest may be okay for Social Darwinists but not for followers of the gospel of compassion and love.\u201d The Georgetown scholars pointed to the devastating impact of cuts in food programs that keep the poor from starvation. From personal experience, they also \u201cknow how cuts in Pell Grants will make it difficult for low-income students to pursue their educations at colleges across the nation, including Georgetown.\u201d The scholars corrected Mr. Ryan on his use of the Catholic concept of \u201csubsidiarity\u201d as \u201ca rationale gutting government programs.\u201d The scholars say that it is true that \u201cIt calls for solutions to be enacted as close to the level of local communities as possible. But it also demands that higher levels of government provide help\u2014\u2018subsidium\u2019\u2014when communities and local governments face problems beyond their means to address such as economic crises, high unemployment, endemic poverty and hunger.\u201d The scholars also gave the Representative a reading assignment: \u201cThe Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church,\u201d which was commissioned by John Paul II and published by the Vatican. Signing the letter were over a dozen Georgetown Jesuit priests, numerous members of the Theology and other departments including History, Government, Philosophy, School of Foreign Service and School of Nursing & Health Studies.",

Rick Perry is on the attack, claiming in a new TV ad that President Obama is waging a \"War on Religion,\" and he's the GOP candidate that can defend faith in America. \"I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a Christian, but you don't need to be in the pew every Sunday to know there's something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. As President, I'll end Obama's war on religion. And I'll fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage,\" says Perry in the new ad titled \"Strong.\" The ad is a state-wide buy in Iowa that starts Wednesday. Perry ties his faith to his conservative stands on social issues, and the campaign has zeroed in on gay marriage and social issues recently, releasing several statements laying out its argument that Obama is attacking the fundamentals social conservative believe in. The arguments range from President Obama directing the Justice Department to stop arguing for the Defense of Marriage Act, to less substantive examples like Obama leaving God out of his Thanksgiving speech this year. In one emailed statement, Perry stated, \"just when you thought Barack Obama couldn't get any more out of touch with America's values, AP reports his administration wants to make foreign aid decisions based on gay rights. This administration's war on traditional American values must stop. This is just the most recent example of an administration at war with people of faith in this country. Investing tax dollars promoting a lifestyle many Americas of faith find so deeply objectionable is wrong. \"Perry is referring to a presidential memorandum released by the White House, in which Obama has directed all agencies working abroad ensure U.S. diplomacy and aid programs \"promote and protect\" the rights of gays and lesbians. Perry is a Methodist. He has never shied away from his faith during this campaign, and in earlier appeal to key evangelical voters, he released another ad in Iowa describing himself as a \"man of faith.\" This latest ad \"Strong\" ends with Perry claiming, \"faith made America strong. It can make her strong again.\"",

        "body": " Every Senate Republican has signed onto a letter vowing to block all Democratic-backed legislation until the chamber extends the Bush tax cuts and approves a spending bill to keep the government running, Fox News has learned. Throwing down the gauntlet, all 42 members of the GOP caucus are sending the letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid warning him that they will bring matters to a standstill unless he swiftly brings those tax-and-spending issues to the floor. That means putting on the backburner a push to repeal the military's policy banning gays from serving openly in the military, a bill giving illegal immigrant students and military members a pathway to legal status and an extension of long-term unemployment benefits. \"While there are other items that might ultimately be worthy of the Senate's attention, we cannot agree to prioritize any matters above the critical issues of funding the government and preventing a job-killing tax hike,\" they wrote.  \"Given our struggling economy, preventing the tax increase and providing economic certainty should be our top priority.\" \"This strategy is very cynical but very obvious and transparent,\" he said in a statement. A panel of administration officials and bipartisan lawmakers is getting to work Wednesday to try to hash out a compromise over what to do about the expiring Bush tax cuts.  Democrats want them extended for all but the wealthy, while Republicans want them extended for everybody. President Obama met with top GOP and Democratic congressional leaders Tuesday but left the nitty-gritty negotiations to the panel -- he assigned Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and budget director Jacob Lew to represent the administration.  Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the representative for Senate Democrats, indicated Wednesday he's not worried about the impact the GOP letter will have on the talks. \"We have full confidence we're going to be able to handle all of this very well,\" he said. But with Republicans vowing to deprive Democrats of the 60 votes they need to move toward a vote on virtually anything until these issues are addressed, negotiators will have to move quickly if they want to get to other matters before a new, more Republican Congress is sworn in next month. The administration is still looking to repeal the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy after the Pentagon issued a report Tuesday claiming the policy shift would not harm the military in the long-run. Democrats also want to extend long-term jobless benefits, which expired Tuesday.  A memo circulated by a GOP analyst noted that Reid so far has not been able to peel off any Republicans to support the measure to give benefits beyond 99 weeks. The lame-duck Congress so far has approved a food safety bill, which still needs a final vote in the House, and a $4.5 billion settlement payment to black farmers and American Indians who claimed they were discriminated against by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Interior. Lawmakers also passed a one-month extension of the \"doc fix\" that prevents cuts to Medicare approved 15 years ago from going into effect, but without action the rates paid to doctors for treating those insured by the entitlement program will plummet on Jan. 1. It's not just Republicans who are concerned about the way the lame-duck session became a dumping ground for campaign promises and wish-list legislation. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., was caught on a hot mic in the Senate ripping the lame-duck agenda, which was set exclusively by his party, as \"rigged\" and done without a discussion among members. Aside from the tax rates, lawmakers must pass this week a continuing resolution to keep the government functioning.  Election-harried Democrats opted against producing a budget at all this year, preferring to punt questions on tax rates and spending until after Nov. 2.  So, the government relies on a series of patches to keep operating. Similarly, lawmakers must vote on a supplemental appropriation to fund military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The filibuster threat increases pressure on the White House to offer a more realistic agenda for the remaining weeks of the year.  For example, if Congress doesn't act on the tax cuts, it means Republicans will be in position to enact their own, retroactive plan starting Jan. 1 without having to make any concessions to Democratic demands for upper-income earners.",

A group of nearly 90 professors and administrators connected to the Jesuit-founded school in Washington, D.C., has sent Ryan, R-Wis., a letter saying he\u2019s misused Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing, GOP House budget. \u201cWe appreciate your willingness to talk about how Catholic social teaching can help inform effective policy in dealing with the urgent challenges facing our country,\u201d the letter states. \u201cHowever, we would be remiss \u2026 if we did not challenge your continuing misuse of Catholic teaching to defend a budget plan that decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few.\u201d Ryan, since introducing the budget last month, has talked about the doctrine in several interviews including one a couple weeks ago on the Christian Broadcasting Network. In that interview, he invoked the Catholic teaching of \"subsidiarity,\" saying it means \"not having big government crowd out civic society, but ... having enough space in our communities so that we can interact with each other\" and take care of people. \"To me, the principle of subsidiarity, which is really federalism, meaning government closest to the people governs best,\" he said. The Georgetown University letter argues, though, that Ryan misappropriated the Catholic teaching as a \u201crationale for gutting government programs.\u201d The writers acknowledge that the teaching indeed calls for local-level solutions to problems but say it is \u201cnot a free pass to dismantle government\u201d and requires higher levels of government. The statement also quotes from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress saying budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to the poor. Ryan, a Catholic and chairman of the House Budget Committee, said last week the letters do not express the views of all U.S. bishops, a point on which the conference disagrees. Georgetown's Public Policy Institute, which is hosting the upcoming Ryan lecture, said Wednesday the event is still scheduled for Thursday morning. \"Chairman Ryan remains grateful for Georgetown's invitation to advance a thoughtful dialogue this week on his efforts to avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the first and the worst,\u201d a Ryan spokesman said. \u201cHe looks forward to affirming our shared commitment to a preferential option for the poor, which of course does not mean a preferential option for bigger government.\" Ryan, who was raised on Social Security benefits after his father died, also on Fox News defended his budget against the conference, saying for instance that the concept of denying tax credits to illegal immigrants is merely \"following through on policy\" that has had bipartisan support.",

The president\u2019s comments, made to reporters as he left Washington for a policy announcement in Utah, saw Trump wading deeper into the Flynn investigation even after a weekend tweet landed the White House in hot water. On Monday, Trump said he feels \u201cbadly\u201d for Flynn, who pleaded guilty on Friday to giving false statements to the FBI about his Russia contacts. \u201cHillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI, nothing happened to her. Flynn lied and they destroyed his life,\u201d Trump said.  The president, without offering specifics, said his 2016 Democratic rival \u201clied many times\u201d during her FBI interview in early July. \u201cNothing happened to her. Flynn lied and it\u2019s like they ruined his life. Very unfair,\u201d Trump said, echoing a weekend tweet in which he asked whether a \u201cdouble standard\u201d was at play. Clinton was interviewed by FBI agents as part of the investigation into her exclusive use of a private email system while secretary of state.  After that interview, then-FBI Director James Comey called her actions extremely careless without recommending criminal charges. Trump also noted over the weekend that Clinton was not recorded or under oath during that interview. On Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., suggested Trump might want to think twice before tweeting and commenting on the Russia case.  \u201cYou tweet and comment regarding ongoing criminal investigations at your own peril,\u201d he said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d This was after Trump\u2019s account tweeted Saturday: \u201cI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.  He has pled guilty to those lies.  It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful.  There was nothing to hide!\u201d That tweet immediately caused problems for the White House, as some legal experts said it potentially exposed the president to obstruction of justice allegations \u2013 since, according to the tweet, he would have known Flynn lied to agents when he allegedly asked Comey to lay off the Flynn investigation and later fired Comey.  Trump said earlier this year that he fired Flynn only for lying to Vice President Pence about the issue. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer John Dowd later said he was the one who wrote that tweet, saying he \u201cdid not mean to break news.\u201d Dowd attempted to explain Sunday that the tweet was referring to then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates telling White House Counsel Don McGahn in January that Flynn had \u201cgiven the agents the same story he gave the vice president.\u201d He also said the agents seemed to think Flynn was confused.  \u201cAll the president knew was that the department was not accusing him of lying,\u201d Dowd said. Trump over the weekend denied that he asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that the panel has begun to see \"the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice\" against Trump. Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigators in the Russia meddling case, though it\u2019s unclear what exactly he might reveal about Trump and his associates.
