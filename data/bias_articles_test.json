Chris Christie (R) and the New Jersey Republican State Committee, as part of its investigation into the \"Bridgegate\" scandal. In a statement issued Thursday, Mark Sheridan, a partner with Patton Boggs, said his law firm had been retained to represent both the campaign and the committee in connection with the investigation. \"We can confirm that the Christie for Governor re-election campaign and the New Jersey Republican State Committee received subpoenas for documents from the U.S. Attorney's office, in addition to the subpoena the campaign previously received from the state legislative committee,\" said Sheridan. \"All three subpoenas focus on the closure of lanes on the George Washington Bridge. The campaign and the state party intend to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's office and the state legislative committee and will respond to the subpoenas accordingly.\" The Christie administration closed down two of the three George Washington Bridge access lanes in Fort Lee, N.J., in September, in what appeared to be a political retribution scheme aimed at the borough's Democratic mayor. The closures, which lasted for four days, caused massive traffic jams. They were orchestrated by a Christie ally at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, David Wildstein, along with one of Christie's deputy chiefs of staff, Bridget Kelly, and his then-campaign manager and top political adviser, Bill Stepien. Christie has maintained that he had no involvement in, or knowledge of, the plan. The New Jersey state legislature is also investigating the lane closures. The FBI and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, meanwhile, are looking into separate controversies over whether the Christie administration misused Hurricane Sandy relief dollars.",

        "body": " Roger Stone, an eccentric longtime Republican strategist with a tattoo of Richard Nixon\u2019s face on his back, was arrested early Friday on criminal charges that include obstruction of an official proceeding, false statements and witness tampering. A federal grand jury impaneled by special counsel Robert Mueller charged Stone in a seven-count indictment. FBI agents arrested him at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and he appeared in court later Friday. CNN shared footage of FBI agents arriving at the property: Kristin Davis, the former Manhattan madam, reportedly told The Washington Post\u2019s Manuel Roig-Franzia that FBI agents also executed a search warrant at the New York City apartment she shared with Stone. Stone \u2015 who worked on presidential campaigns for Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and others \u2015 took credit for Donald Trump\u2019s presidential run and served as an informal adviser after he left Trump\u2019s campaign in August 2015. He repeatedly has said it was \u201ca possibility\u201d that he would be indicted in Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible Trump campaign collusion. Stone has previously admitted to being in contact with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks during the Trump campaign. The indictment alleges he spoke \u201cto senior Trump Campaign officials\u201d about WikiLeaks and \u201cinformation it might have had that would be damaging\u201d to the campaign of Trump\u2019s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in the summer before the election. Stone was \u201ccontacted by senior Trump Campaign officials to inquire about future releases\u201d by WikiLeaks, according to the indictment, which refers to WikiLeaks as \u201cOrganization 1.\u201d Stone\u2019s attorney, Grant Smith, said in a statement that \u201cthere was no Russian collusion\u201d and that the charges were \u201ca clear attempt at silencing Roger.\u201d After appearing in court on Friday, Stone said he plans to plead not guilty to the charges, saying he was \u201cfalsely accused\u201d and calling the investigation \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d \u201cI look forward to being fully and completely vindicated,\u201d he said, while onlookers booed. He also affirmed that he does not plan to testify against Trump, but would not say if he seeks a pardon from the president. The July 2018 indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers in connection with the hack of a Democratic National Committee server during the 2016 election referred to Stone as \u201ca person who was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump.\u201d Stone has described his contact with the Russians \u2015 who used the handle \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d \u2015 as \u201cbenign.\u201d He told The Washington Post that he met with a Russian national who wanted to sell Trump damaging information on Hillary Clinton for a sum of $2 million. The man had previously worked as an informant for the FBI, but told the Post that he was not working on the FBI\u2019s behalf when he met with Stone in May 2016. Stone\u2019s indictment came after his associate Randy Credico, a radio show host, testified before the grand jury. Stone, according to the indictment, \u201con multiple occasions\u201d around Dec. 1, 2017, told Credico (\u201cPerson 2\u201d) that he should \u201cdo a \u2018Frank Pentangeli\u2019\u201d in his testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \u201cto avoid contradicting Stone\u2019s testimony.\u201d It was a reference to the \u201cFrankie Five Angels\u201d character from \u201cThe Godather: Part II,\u201d whom the indictment alleges Stone and Credico had previously discussed. In the film, the character testifies and \u201cclaims not to know critical information that he does in fact know,\u201d the indictment recounts.",

        "body": " Democrats\u2019 landmark campaign finance, voting rights and ethics reform bill passed the House of Representatives on Friday. The For The People Act, which passed 234-193, was Democrats\u2019 top priority upon winning control of the House in the 2018 elections. It would dramatically expand voting access, create publicly funded House elections, enhance the transparency of money in politics, restore voting rights to millions of ex-felons, strengthen executive branch ethics law and end partisan gerrymandering. \u201cThis is a historic day, a pivotal day, a day that will make a difference,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said. The bill aims to answer rising attacks on voting rights from courts and politicians across the country, and also to stem the increasing inequality of campaign funding by empowering small donors with matching contributions from public funds, among many other things. The For The People Act \u201ctakes power from the elites, special interests and the 1 percent and gives it to the American people,\u201d Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) said. \u201cThis vote is an opportunity to be on the right side of history,\u201d Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said. \u201cIf not us, then who? If not now, then when?\u201d House passage of the legislation is the result of a long collaborative process by the Democratic Party to prioritize campaign finance and voting rights reforms. The party\u2019s Democracy Reform Task Force, endorsed by Pelosi and led by Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), worked with lawmakers both old and new to bring together legislative ideas and craft them into a coherent package. Much of this work was begun while Democrats languished in the House minority. As a possible victory in the 2018 elections loomed, they made it clear that the reforms would be their No. 1 priority. This mission was driven not just by party leaders, but also by the candidates who would ultimately deliver Democrats their first majority in the House in eight years. One-hundred candidates, including those who won their 2018 races, signed a letter to Pelosi and other congressional leaders demanding the reforms be the first order of business. Many cited the endemic corruption of money in politics as a top complaint they heard on the campaign trail from constituents. The vote broke down on party lines, with Republicans in hardened opposition. During multiple committee hearings and floor debate, GOP representatives castigated the bill as a federal power grab designed to help Democrats win elections by allowing increased voting access and nonpartisan gerrymandering. They said the campaign finance disclosures and the public funding of elections assaulted free speech rights, the ethics laws were too broad and unnecessary, and the creation of a federal election day holiday was an unnecessary benefit for lazy workers. The Senate will not take up the bill, according to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). McConnell is perhaps the nation\u2019s biggest opponent of campaign finance reforms, and the Republican Party has enacted measures across the country in the last decade to restrict voter access. Those restrictions would be overturned by the For The People Act. Still, Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) announced the outlines of a Senate companion bill on Wednesday. President Donald Trump has been advised to veto the legislation if it reaches his desk. Democrats believe that the reform package is popular and plan to vote on individual pieces of it to keep the issues of corruption and voting rights front and center. They are already pursuing a reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act in a separate bill. And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on Thursday that he would like to mandate automatic voter registration across the country. The House bill \u201cis just the first step in our efforts to change politics in this country \u2015 to change politics in this town,\u201d freshman Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.) said on Thursday ahead of the vote. \u201cThis is a fight that will not end until we win it,\u201d Pelosi said.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama on Friday forcefully defended revelations that the National Security Agency is collecting phone records and electronic communications, saying that Congress was fully briefed and the programs are limited in scope. \"The programs are secret in the sense that they are classified. They are not secret, in that every member of Congress has been briefed,\" he said during a speech in San Jose, Calif. \"These are programs that have been authored by large bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006.\" \"Your duly elected representatives have consistently been informed,\" he said. News outlets revealed this week that vast spying programs began under President George W. Bush and have continued under Obama. The Guardian reported Wednesday that the National Security Agency had obtained a court order to collect phone records from Verizon Wireless customers, while The Washington Post reported Thursday of the existence of a program launched in 2007 called PRISM, which tracks information from nine leading U.S. Internet companies: Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, AOL, YouTube, Apple, PalTalk and Skype. In response to a question after his speech, Obama defended the programs as essential to combating terrorist threats. \"They may identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism,\" he said. He also argued that some have overstated the impact of the programs. \"Some of the hype we've been hearing over the past day or so -- nobody has listened to the content of people's phone calls,\" he said. \"I welcome this debate and I think it's healthy for our democracy,\" he continued. \"I think it's a sign of maturity, because probably five years ago, six years ago, we might not have been having this debate.\" Obama portrayed the programs as a trade-off between security and civil liberties. \"I think it's important to recognize that you can't have 100 percent security, and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience. We're going to have to make some choices as a society,\" he said. He also expressed his displeasure that the domestic spying programs' existence was leaked to the press. \"I don't welcome leaks,\" he said. \"There's a reason these programs are classified.\" The president's full-throated defense of the programs, albeit with the qualification that he welcomes debate, is unlikely to quell the outrage over the revelations. Obama ran as an antidote to Bush's policies in 2008, but the reports reveal that he has continued many of them, leading to concerns over the reach of the national security state. Obama went on to defend those who operated the programs as \"professionals.\" \"In the abstract, you can complain about 'Big Brother' and how this is a potential program run amok. But when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance,\" he said.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The lawmakers trotted from their dugouts at Nationals Park, together in a near-summer air that never quite felt swampy, united in a certainty that the game must go on, just not exactly as it had before. A day earlier, on another ball field some seven miles southwest, a gunman had opened fire on members of the Republican congressional baseball team, striking four people \u2014 including Steve Scalise, the majority whip of the House of Representatives \u2014 who were there for a practice. And on Thursday, the capital\u2019s various institutional forces \u2014 senators and lobbyists, staff members with a job to do and residents with an evening to spare \u2014 joined, for a moment, in a bipartisan rebuttal: Play ball. Beneath a mostly cloudless sky, at least by the mid-innings, fans in the stands intermingled red and blue. Near the dugout, the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump bantered with Chuck Schumer, the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, who chatted with two of her young children. Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, wore a shirt from Louisiana State University, Mr. Scalise\u2019s alma mater. When a video message from President Trump played on the big screen, some of the Democrats in the crowd booed, but less lustily than usual. \u201cYou are showing the world that we will not be intimidated,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe game will go on.\u201d Some members of Congress had not expected to stay behind for the annual showdown, with families and district business waiting for them. But by nightfall, the decision was clear. \u201cWe come here, and these members become our family,\u201d Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, said at the Capitol before a game he had not intended to see. He spoke of 1968 and of the political violence he had seen up close as a civil rights leader, invoking Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. Mr. Lewis, now 77, stared straight ahead for a moment. \u201cI have to stay,\u201d he said softly. All day, before as more than 24,000 ticket holders filed in for the charity game, the shorthand for other tragedies ricocheted through the Capitol. At work on Thursday, those pangs visited lawmakers like a too-familiar houseguest \u2014 stalking them down the Capitol\u2019s corridors, past the Senate chamber where a ferocious health care debate had already resumed, along the hall where some had stood one day earlier as survivors, still in dusted cleats and uniforms, unharmed but unsettled. The reaction would be different this time, some said. More sustainable. It had to be. Probably. Maybe. Right? \u201cWhat\u2019s the half-life?\u201d asked Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, appraising how long the comity might last. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d The skepticism is near-universal. Even one day out from the initial anguish, much of the political ecosystem seemed unchanged. In a Thursday morning tweet, Mr. Trump railed against the \u201cWITCH HUNT\u201d of investigations of his associates. Elected officials accused one another of hypocrisy and selective memory on matters of policy, perhaps a bit more gently than they might have on a typical weekday. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said he was warming up with Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, who is not known for bipartisan spirit. And Ms. Pelosi could not resist suggesting that Republicans were the initiators of the present rancor. \u201cSomewhere in the \u201990s, Republicans decided on a politics of personal destruction as they went after the Clintons,\u201d she told reporters earlier on Thursday. Moments later, she added, a bit regretfully: \u201cI really am almost sad for myself that I have gone down this path with you, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for us to have the fullest discussion of it. It\u2019ll be for another day.\u201d But for an optimist in the city \u2014 and there still seem to be a few \u2014 there were flourishes to appreciate. House interns hauled signs: \u201cScalise Strong,\u201d \u201cCapitol Police MVP\u201d and \u201cUnvidvided\u201d in red, white, and blue. Another attendee delivered this message, held aloft: \u201cThis Democrat is here to support Congressman Scalise. Get well soon, sir.\u201d Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, resolved to wear a \u201cTeam Scalise\u201d shirt to the game. Ms. Pelosi sat for an interview alongside Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. The Senate leaders \u2014 Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and Mr. Schumer of New York \u2014 did the same. \u201cWe don\u2019t dislike each other,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, deploying a rare complimentary double negative. Among those on the field before the game was Representative Roger Williams, Republican of Texas, whose aide Zachary Barth was shot at the practice. Mr. Williams, a coach on the team, trudged out on crutches after injuring his foot in the Wednesday morning fray as well. David Bailey, a Capitol Police officer who was wounded while helping to stop the attack, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. (The ball was delivered to the mound, in an apparent bit of sponsorship oddity, by a Budweiser Clydesdale.) Mr. Scalise remained in the hospital on Thursday after a second surgery for internal injuries and a broken leg. Doctors said his condition was critical but improving. He received a standing ovation when he was introduced as a team member, with Democrats waving their caps at his image on the screen beyond the outfield fence. \u201cMaybe with a little more time, the teams would be mixed,\u201d suggested Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida. \u201cBut at least for now, the healthy competition will bring us together.\u201d Several elements of the evening did diverge sharply from the ballpark\u2019s standard, professional fare \u2014 commonplace for a congressional game that has, since 1909, produced a steady torrent of middling baseball, worse trash talk and more than occasional injury. By the concessions, attendees discussed field director salaries and legislative wrangling. Khakis filled the grounds. A cutout of the head of Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, was held high. Chants of \u201cWe love you, Pelosi!\u201d rang out briefly, until the minority leader acknowledged them. Supporters from both parties raised hot dogs and beers, catching up on acquaintances in common. \u201cWe\u2019re just one day removed, so it still feels different, I think,\u201d Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said before the game, recalling past tragedies that many swore would reshape the nation\u2019s politics. \u201cI hope it lasts.\u201d At the practice on Wednesday, Mr. Flake had raced to Mr. Scalise\u2019s side to provide water and first aid after the shooting stopped. He set out a goal for himself and his colleagues, uttered before inside the Capitol. \u201cTone down our own rhetoric and not ascribe the worst motives to our colleagues,\u201d he said hopefully. \u201cThat can be done.\u201d For an evening, at least, Washington delivered. A little before 10 p.m., the Democrats secured their final out for an 11-2 victory, taking a 40-to-39 edge in the lifetime series. As the players shook hands, the team managers \u2014 Representative Mike Doyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania, and Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas \u2014 gathered for closing ceremonies. Mr. Doyle did not hold the trophy for long. It was going to Mr. Scalise\u2019s office, they decided, until he gets back.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, revealed on Friday the most direct link yet between parallel efforts by the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election using Democratic Party material stolen by Russians. A top Trump campaign official dispatched Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to President Trump, to get information from WikiLeaks about the thousands of hacked Democratic emails, according to an indictment. The effort began weeks after Democratic officials publicly accused Russian intelligence operatives of the theft, which was part of Moscow\u2019s broad campaign to sabotage the 2016 presidential race. The indictment made no mention of whether Mr. Trump played a role in the coordination, though Mr. Mueller did leave a curious clue about how high in the campaign the effort reached: A senior campaign official \u201cwas directed\u201d by an unnamed person to contact Mr. Stone about additional WikiLeaks releases that might damage the Clinton campaign, according to the court document. In an indictment filled with colorful details about clandestine meetings, angry texts \u2014 even a reference to \u201cThe Godfather: Part II\u201d \u2014 Mr. Stone was charged with seven counts, including obstruction, making false statements and witness tampering. Mr. Mueller did not say that Mr. Stone\u2019s interactions with WikiLeaks were illegal, nor that the Trump campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the organization. F.B.I. agents arrested Mr. Stone before dawn, appearing at his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., home with ballistic vests and guns drawn. Agents typically use those tactics as a precaution to secure possible evidence and protect themselves in case a suspect fights arrest. Prosecutors sealed details of the case because they feared that public disclosure would increase the risk of Mr. Stone fleeing or destroying or tampering with evidence, according to court documents. F.B.I. agents were also seen carting hard drives and other evidence from Mr. Stone\u2019s apartment in Harlem, and his recording studio in South Florida was also raided. Mr. Stone appeared briefly on Friday morning in Federal District Court in Fort Lauderdale, his ankles and waist shackled in front of a packed courtroom. A man known for his dapper wardrobe was dressed simply in a navy blue cotton polo shirt, bluejeans and his trademark round, black-rimmed glasses. Afterward, in a theatrical appearance outside the courthouse, Mr. Stone vowed to beat what he called politically motivated charges. \u201cThere is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies to ease the pressure on myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to being fully and completely vindicated,\u201d he added, then flashed twin V-for-victory hand signs reminiscent of his political hero, former President Richard M. Nixon. In a brief interview later, Mr. Stone said he will plead not guilty, and people close to him have predicted that Mr. Trump could pardon Mr. Stone should he be convicted of any of the charges. The indictment is the first in months by Mr. Mueller, who is investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination with Trump associates. Citing details in emails and other forms of communications, the indictment suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign knew about additional stolen emails before they were released and asked Mr. Stone to find out about them. According to the indictment, between June and July 2016, Mr. Stone told \u201csenior Trump campaign officials\u201d about the stolen emails in WikiLeaks\u2019 possession that could be damaging to Mrs. Clinton. On July 22 that year, WikiLeaks released its first batch of Democratic emails. After that, according to the indictment, the Trump campaign sought more. \u201cA senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton campaign,\u201d the indictment said, referring to WikiLeaks. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, sought to broadly distance Mr. Trump from the charges. \u201cThe charges brought against Mr. Stone have nothing to do with the president,\u201d she told CNN. Asked whether he directed a campaign aide to contact Mr. Stone about the WikiLeaks emails, she repeated that the charges did not involve Mr. Trump. A self-described dirty trickster, Mr. Stone began his career as a Nixon campaign aide and has a tattoo of Nixon on his back. He has spent decades plying the political dark arts \u2014 including scandal-mongering \u2014 to help influence American election campaigns, and has long maintained that he had no connection to Russia\u2019s attempts to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. He sometimes seemed to taunt American law enforcement agencies, daring them to find hard evidence to link him to Moscow\u2019s interference; it is illegal for a political campaign to accept foreign aid. His brash behavior made him less of a subject of news media scrutiny than other current and former aides to President Trump \u2014 like the character in a whodunit whom readers immediately dismiss as too obvious to have committed the crime. The indictment does not mention whether Mr. Stone or any other Trump associate knew about the Russian operatives\u2019 plans before they hacked the Democrats. In social media posts and interviews during the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Stone indicated that he had advance knowledge that a trove of information damaging to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign might be about to spill into public view, and even suggested that he had personally spoken to the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange. Mr. Stone has changed his story as investigators closed in, saying that he was not actually speaking to Mr. Assange and that he had no direct knowledge that Russians were responsible for the Democratic hacking. Still, it was revealed last year that, in the weeks before the election, Mr. Stone was messaging on Twitter with Guccifer 2.0, a pseudonym used by one or more operatives in the Russian intelligence scheme to steal the emails and funnel them to WikiLeaks. Three senior Trump campaign officials told Mr. Mueller\u2019s team that Mr. Stone created the impression that he was a conduit for inside information from WikiLeaks, according to people familiar with their witness interviews. One of them told investigators that Mr. Stone not only seemed to predict WikiLeaks\u2019 actions, but also that he took credit afterward for the timing of its disclosures that damaged Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy. In October 2016, Mr. Stone exchanged emails with Stephen K. Bannon, then the chief executive of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. In one exchange, Mr. Stone wrote that more WikiLeaks disclosures were forthcoming, \u201ca load every week going forward,\u201d according to the indictment. Mr. Bannon appears to be the official described in the court document as \u201cthe high-ranking Trump Campaign official,\u201d based on previous disclosures about the email exchange. A day before Mr. Stone and Mr. Bannon emailed about WikiLeaks, Donald Trump Jr. exchanged messages on Twitter with the WikiLeaks account and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about.\u201d At the end of that week, on Oct. 7, WikiLeaks released more than 6,000 emails related to John D. Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign. The release, 30 minutes after The Washington Post published a recording of Mr. Trump bragging about assaulting women, appeared aimed at redirecting negative attention from Mr. Trump to the Clinton campaign. The special counsel\u2019s investigators spent months encircling Mr. Stone, and the indictment unsealed on Friday detailed how he relied on several longtime associates to get information about the timing and content of WikiLeaks\u2019 document releases in the months before the election. They pored over his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The indictment documented numerous lies to lawmakers about his efforts to set up a back channel to WikiLeaks, and about his efforts to pressure other witnesses to lie. He exchanged heated texts with Randy Credico, a New York radio host with his own contacts with WikiLeaks, pressuring Mr. Credico to lie to the Intelligence Committee so that his story would line up with Mr. Stone\u2019s. Mr. Stone told Mr. Credico he should \u201cdo a \u2018Frank Pentangeli\u2019\u201d before the House committee, the indictment said, a reference to a \u201cGodfather\u201d character who lies to Congress about his interactions with the Mafia. The tumultuous relationship between Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump goes back decades, with Mr. Stone serving as an informal adviser as Mr. Trump considered running for president several times. When Mr. Trump formally announced during the spring of 2015 that he was running for president, Mr. Stone was one of the first to join his campaign. Within months, however, the two had a public dispute and Mr. Stone left the team. But they have remained close, speaking often by telephone. On Friday, the day that Mr. Stone stood on the steps of a courthouse and pledged his enduring loyalty to the president, Mr. Trump bashed the investigation that had led armed federal agents to his friend\u2019s house in the morning darkness. \u201cGreatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country!\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cNO COLLUSION!\u201d",

A strong defender of Israel, he has been sharply critical of Mr. Obama\u2019s treatment of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and said a proposed nuclear deal with Iran is \u201cterrible\u201d because Iran cannot be trusted. Mr. Huckabee has talked of the possibility of using military force against Iran. As governor of Arkansas in 2002, he called for lifting the economic embargo of Cuba, which would have helped rice farmers in his state. But he now opposes Mr. Obama\u2019s warming of relations with Havana, calling Cuba\u2019s government tyrannical. In 2007 Mr. Huckabee was quoted as saying, \u201cClimate change is here, it\u2019s real.\u201d But more recently he has minimized it as a threat, and said he opposes \u201ccap and trade\u201d legislation meant to curtail carbon emissions. \u201cThis kind of mandatory energy policy would have a horrible impact on this nation\u2019s job market,\u201d he said. Mr. Huckabee opposes same-sex marriage, suggesting as recently as February that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice akin to drinking or swearing. Mr. Huckabee said Mr. Obama exceeded his authority by issuing executive actions shielding millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. But Mr. Huckabee said the immigrant children whose parents brought them into the country illegally should not be deported because \u201cyou don\u2019t punish a child for something his parents did.\u201d Mr. Huckabee has focused his economic message on what he calls wage stagnation under Mr. Obama. But the former governor has opposed calls for a higher minimum wage, calling it government intrusion, and he has suggested that policies that encourage a dependency on federal benefits have helped hold wages down. Unlike other Republican candidates, Mr. Huckabee is a strong defender of entitlement programs, opposing plans to raise the retirement age for collecting Social Security and criticizing plans to curtail Medicare. Republicans who back such changes, he said, \u201care embracing a government that lied to its people \u2014 that took money from its people under one pretense and then took it away at the time when they started wanting to actually get what they have paid for all these years.\u201d",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2015 President Donald Trump\u2019s offer to Democrats over the weekend seeking to trade temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border received positive coverage from some outlets, including being called a \u201ccompromise\u201d and a move by Trump \u201ctoward the center.\u201d But the latest details in the proposal, which Senate Republicans unveiled Monday in a bill they plan to vote on this week, make the offer appear less of a compromise and more of a wish list for immigration hard-liners like White House adviser Stephen Miller. Trump is offering a three-year extension for the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. as kids. The offer would also give a three-year extension to 300,000 people from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Honduras who are living in the U.S. under the temporary protected status program. Democrats rejected the offer before Trump even announced it on Saturday, however, maintaining that it didn\u2019t go nearly far enough and that the president ought to reopen the government before any negotiations over the border proceed. But the GOP bill incorporating his offer would also gut existing asylum laws for children and trafficking victims from Central America, ban asylum for minors who present themselves at ports of entry, gut the concept of temporary protected status for future cases and expand immigration detention \u2015 all measures making it more likely to be dead on arrival in the Senate. \u201cGiven the poison pills stuffed into a proposal that was supposed to entice Democrats we can now say the Trump \u2018offer\u2019 isn\u2019t about getting to a deal but about shifting blame. So obvious. So predictable. So pathetic,\u201d Frank Sharry, the executive director of the immigration advocacy group America\u2019s Voice, tweeted on Tuesday. The bill would ban asylum for Central American minors, including those who arrive at the border with their parents, unless the minors apply for asylum in their home country. It would also cap the number of Central American minors who are allowed to apply for asylum each year at 50,000 and limit the number of asylum applications that could be granted per year to 15,000. The administration has for months tried to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in the U.S. as part of a broader effort to stem the flow of Central American migrants crossing the border from Mexico. Trump\u2019s administrative attempts to curtail the asylum process have faced legal challenges in two federal courts, however, prompting this week\u2019s legislative fix. \u201cThis bill includes the most extreme changes on asylum that I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Kerri Talbot, the director of federal advocacy at the group Immigration Hub, said on a press call on Tuesday. Under the GOP bill, minors who apply for asylum would face much stiffer consequences for filing an application found to be frivolous \u2015 including permanent ineligibility for future protections. The bill\u2019s changes to asylum law alarmed immigration activists online, as well some on the right, including attorney and conservative writer Gabriel Malor. Trump\u2019s efforts to win over Democratic support on the bill \u2015 which will require at least 60 votes to pass in the Senate \u2015 hit even more trouble on Tuesday after the Supreme Court once again did not act on the administration\u2019s effort to end DACA. The move essentially left protections for Dreamers in place for at least the next several months \u2015 giving Democrats less incentive to agree to Trump\u2019s offer of protections to DACA recipients.",

        "body": " The Obama administration found itself defending -- and beginning to explain -- yet another surveillance effort after leaked documents revealed information about two secret National Security Agency intelligence-gathering programs. On top of a Guardian newspaper report that revealed how authorities were collecting phone records from millions, a Washington Post report detailed another program that scours major Internet companies including Google and Facebook for data. A former senior NSA official confirmed to Fox News that the program was started in 2007 by the FBI and NSA and allows them to tap into top U.S. Internet companies to pull audio, video and other data. While civil liberties groups cried foul over the program, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper issued a statement late Thursday decrying the leak of the materials. He called the disclosure of the program that allows the NSA to collect communications data from Internet companies \"reprehensible\" and said the phone-records monitoring leak could cause harm to the nation's intelligence gathering activities. At the same time, he took the rare step of moving to declassify information about the programs as he sought to defend them against criticism. \u201cThe article omits key information regarding how a classified intelligence collection program is used to prevent terrorist attacks and the numerous safeguards that protect privacy and civil liberties,\" he said of the Guardian story. Clapper also said the government was \"prohibited from indiscriminately sifting through the telephony metadata acquired under the program.\u201d All information acquired, he said, \u201cis subject to strict, court-imposed restrictions on review and handling. The court only allows the data to be queried when there is a reasonable suspicion, based on specific facts, that the particular basis for the query is associated with a foreign terrorist organization.\u201c Several hours earlier, a senior administration official also pushed back, saying the Guardian article and Washington Post article about the Internet mining refers to collection under a law that \"does not allow the targeting of any U.S. citizen or of any person located within the United States.\u201d It was not immediately clear how the official defined \u201ctargeting.\u201d \u201cThe program is subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch, and Congress,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt involves extensive procedures, specifically approved by the court, to ensure that only non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. are targeted, and that minimize the acquisition, retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about U.S. persons.\u201d A former NSA official told Fox News the FBI and National Security Agency (NSA) have been tapping into leading U.S. Internet companies to pull audio, video and photographs. According to the official, the program began in 2007 and is in the second phase. Metadata from the companies is used to identify suspicious individuals and the secondary search goes into content. The official told Fox News that the Utah Data Center is likely a repository for this material. The classified program is code-named PRISM, the Washington Post reported, and has not been disclosed publicly before. Members of Congress who are aware of the program were reportedly bound by oath to keep it confidential. According to slides from an internal presentation intended for NSA senior analysts and obtained by the Washington Post, the program accounts for nearly one in seven intelligence reports. The companies that participate knowingly in the program are Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple, the Washington Post reports. A number of the Internet companies issued statements Thursday night saying they only complied when legally bound to do so. \"Even when the system works just as advertised, with no American singled out for targeting, the NSA routinely collects a great deal of American content,\" the Washington Post report said. \"That is described as \"incidental,\" and it is inherent in contact chaining, one of the basic tools of the trade.\" To be immune from lawsuits, companies like Yahoo and AOL are reportedly obliged to accept a directive from the attorney general and national intelligence director to open their service to the FBI's Data Intercept Technology Unit, which acts as a liaison between the companies and the NSA. According to the slides, there has been \u201ccontinued exponential growth in tasking to Facebook and Skype.\" \"With a few clicks and an affirmation that the subject is believed to be engaged in terrorism, espionage or nuclear proliferation, an analyst obtains full access to Facebook\u2019s 'extensive search and surveillance capabilities against the variety of online social networking services,'\" the Washington Post reports. Skype can reportedly be monitored for audio when one end of a call is a conventional telephone and also can be monitored for video, chat and file transfers when users connect just by a computer. Google services that can be monitored include Gmail, voice and video chat, Google Drive files, and search terms. A spokesperson for Google says the company \"cares deeply\" about the security of users' data. \"We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law, and we review all such requests carefully,\" the spokesperson said. \"From time to time, people allege that we have created a government 'back door' into our systems, but Google does not have a 'back door' for the government to access private user data.\" \"Protecting the privacy of our users and their data is a top priority for Facebook,\" the company's chief security officer Joe Sullivan said in a statement. \"We do not provide any government organization with direct access to Facebook servers. When Facebook is asked for data or information about specific individuals, we carefully scrutinize any such request for compliance with all applicable laws, and provide information only to the extent required by law.\" A Microsoft spokesperson said that the company only provides customer data after receiving a legally binding order or subpoena. \"In addition we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers,\" the spokesperson said. \"If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data we don't participate in it.\"",

        "body": " President Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general who was one of Trump\u2019s first Cabinet picks, would be retiring at the end of February. Mattis, who served more than four decades in the military and headed the U.S. Central Command from 2010 to 2013, won Senate confirmation as defense secretary on Jan. 20, 2017, shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration. The Pentagon chief, nicknamed \u201cMad Dog Mattis\u201d during his time as a Marine, echoed Trump\u2019s call for strengthening the military and beefing up its combat readiness. The budget bill the president signed into law in February earmarked $700 billion for the Defense Department this fiscal year \u2015 a more than 15 percent increase over the previous year and the biggest hike in military spending since 2002. Mattis\u2019 resignation letter addressed to Trump indicates his final day in office will be Feb. 28. \u201cI am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department\u2019s business practices for greater performance, he wrote. \u201cOur troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.\u201d In the unusual letter, Mattis also wrote that he and Trump had differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism: \u201cBecause you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.\u201d Earlier this week, Trump went against Mattis by abruptly withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria. Mattis had previously argued that a small U.S. presence should remain because the counterterrorism mission there is ongoing and removing troops now would cause more problems for the region. Additionally, forces were withdrawn despite the concern by many Republicans that \u201cleaving would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran, which both support Syrian President Bashar al Assad.\u201d News of Mattis\u2019 departure comes in the wake of reports that the White House had been discussing who might replace him, a topic that was first reported by The Washington Post in early September. Some of the top names that were reportedly under consideration included four-star Army Gen. Jack Keane, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), former Treasury Department official David McCormick and former Republican Sen. Jim Talent of Missouri. Trump denied that he had been looking to replace Mattis, telling reporters that he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with him. That assurance came ahead of the release of a book by acclaimed Watergate journalist Bob Woodward, which reported that Mattis once told staffers that Trump has the understanding of a \u201cfifth- or sixth-grader.\u201d Mattis has denied having said that. A major split between Trump and Mattis concerned Russian President Vladimir Putin. The defense secretary has characterized Putin as trying to undermine NATO and assaulting Western democracies while violating international norms. \u201c[Putin\u2019s] actions are designed not to challenge our arms at this point, but to undercut and compromise our belief in our ideals,\u201d Mattis told U.S. Naval War College graduates at a commencement ceremony in June. Trump, in contrast, has praised Putin\u2019s leadership skills and recently roiled U.S. allies by calling for Russia\u2019s reinstatement to the Group of Seven major industrial nations. Russia was expelled from what was then the Group of Eight after its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Mattis had also argued that the U.S. should consider staying in the Iran nuclear deal unless Tehran was found not to be abiding by the multi-nation agreement. Iran was following the pact\u2019s rules, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the use of nuclear energy and has verified Iranian compliance with the accord multiple times since 2015. Trump went on to pull out of the deal in May, claiming that it had been poorly negotiated during the Obama administration. Mattis opposed Trump\u2019s proposed ban on transgender service members, as well as the use of torture in the interrogation of terrorist suspects. His most prominent moment in the public spotlight occurred in April when he handled briefings on Trump\u2019s decision to conduct targeted airstrikes against Syria in response to the alleged use of chemical weapons by Assad\u2019s regime in that nation\u2019s civil war. Even then, Mattis\u2019 recommendation that congressional approval be sought for the strikes put him at odds with the president. Trump overruled the defense secretary and unilaterally ordered the military assault. Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the administration. Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson earlier this year, and Tom Price stepped aside as secretary of health and human services last fall amid ethical questions about his travel practices. Reince Priebus lasted barely six months as White House chief of staff, and Sean Spicer had a similarly short tenure as press secretary. White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, a Trump aide before he won the presidency, announced her resignation in February. White House deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin, who also served in the Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, is expected to leave his post in July, Politico reported.",

Michael T.

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 AARP, the powerful lobby for older Americans that has been seen as one of the leading opponents of Social Security benefit cuts, said on Friday that it was open to modest reductions in benefits for future recipients. The group\u2019s stance, which generated quick reaction from all sides because of its powerful voice on the issue, could provide added ammunition to fiscal conservatives who have sought unsuccessfully to restructure Social Security and chip away at the benefits it promises older Americans. \u201cOur goal is to limit any changes in benefits,\u201d John Rother, AARP\u2019s policy chief, said in a telephone interview, \u201cbut we also want to see the system made solvent.\u201d Mr. Rother said the group\u2019s stance on possible cuts, which was first reported in The Wall Street Journal in Friday\u2019s editions, should be seen less as a major change in position than as a reflection of the political and financial realities facing the Social Security system and the country as a whole. \u201cYou have to look at all the tradeoffs,\u201d Mr. Rother said, \u201cand what we\u2019re trying to do is engage the American public in that debate.\u201d He made clear that the group\u2019s willingness to discuss cuts comes with conditions: Reductions in benefits should be \u201cminimal,\u201d they should not affect current recipients and instead should be directed \u201cfar off in the future,\u201d and they should be offset by increases in tax-generated revenue. Nonetheless, the group\u2019s openness to the possibility of unspecified cuts was seen as a significant development by people on all sides of the Social Security question because of AARP\u2019s influence on federal policies affecting older Americans, including Medicare, prescription drugs and many more. Third Way, a moderate Democratic group in Washington that has favored possible reductions in benefits, called AARP\u2019s position \u201ca watershed moment\u201d in the debate over Social Security. \u201cNow that they have opened the door to reform, it is time for lawmakers to walk through it,\u201d said Jonathan Cowan, president of Third Way. But other advocacy groups that are pushing to preserve Social Security benefits accused AARP of effectively abandoning its core constituency. Max Richtman, executive vice president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group in Washington, said the timing of AARP\u2019s statements was particularly bad because it came in the midst of deliberations between the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans about the debt ceiling and overall deficit reduction. AARP insisted that the Social Security trust funds should not be raided to reduce the deficit and that the two issues were separate. But Mr. Richtman said the group\u2019s openness to considering future cuts would no doubt be used by deficit hawks to push for immediate cuts in Social Security benefits as part of the debate over deficit reduction. \u201cI think it\u2019s tragic that AARP would, wittingly or unwittingly, play into the hands of people who have never really liked Social Security and want to decimate it,\u201d Mr. Richtman said. \u201cAARP is the 800-pound gorilla, but they do not speak for seniors.\u201d Republican leaders, who have led calls for revamping Social Security, had no immediate comments on AARP\u2019s willingness to consider benefit reductions. An aide to the Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee, who spoke on condition of anonymity under committee protocol, said AARP\u2019s position was a welcome acknowledgment that Social Security would be unable to pay future benefits at the current rate and that it must be restructured. \u201cThe longer we wait,\u201d the aide said, \u201cthe more difficult it will be to protect current beneficiaries and those who rely on Social Security the most.\u201d The most recent projections from the Social Security Administration, issued last month, indicate that at the current rate, the program\u2019s trust funds will be exhausted by 2036, and that $6.5 trillion in additional money will be needed over a 75-year period to pay all scheduled benefits. Mr. Rother said AARP expected to hear criticism from some of its members over its position on possible cuts. \u201cWe have such a broad membership, Mr. Rother said. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be some who will not be happy, but others will be eager to see the program put on a stronger financial footing for the long term.\u201d While AARP has not issued specific recommendations or figures on how benefit reductions might be carried out, the group\u2019s recent discussions with its members signal support for using increased revenue to fill two-thirds of the projected gap, and benefits reductions for one-third, Mr. Rother said. As word of AARP\u2019s position set off debate in Washington on Friday, the group\u2019s chief executive, Barry Rand, issued a formal statement saying that the group\u2019s position had not changed in any substantive way and refuting what he described as \u201cmisleading\u201d media reports. \u201cLet me be clear \u2014 AARP is as committed as we\u2019ve ever been to fighting to protect Social Security for today\u2019s seniors and strengthening it for future generations,\u201d Mr. Rand said. While he did not directly address the question of possible cuts in benefits in his statement, Mr. Rand said his group would be working to evaluate any proposed changes in Social Security \u201cto determine how each might \u2014 individually or in different combinations \u2014 impact the lives of current and future retirees.\u201d",

We reject his message.\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday that he had accepted an invitation to meet Pe\u00f1a Nieto in private. An invitation had also been extended to his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, but the former secretary of state\u2019s campaign said she was looking forward to speaking with him at the \u201cappropriate time.\u201d Trump has spent more than a year railing against Mexico and its leaders, promising the country would pay for the construction of a wall on the border it shares with the U.S., as well as fear-mongering about \u201crapists\u201d and drug dealers that are coming across it. The surprise meeting abroad with a foreign leader will be Trump\u2019s first as a presidential nominee, and is not without risks to his candidacy. Mitt Romney\u2019s trip to Israel during the 2012 presidential campaign, for example, did not go over well. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s approval rating fell to a record low earlier this year amid several corruption scandals. He, too, may seize on the meeting as an opportunity to bolster his image with Mexicans.

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Impeachment was always going to hang heavily over a divided Washington. But it took little more than 24 hours this week for a freshman House Democrat\u2019s exuberant, expletive-laden impeachment promise to upend the bonhomie of a new Congress and prompt President Trump, by his own telling, to ask the newly elected speaker if Democrats planned to impeach him. The episode began Thursday night, just hours after the 116th Congress was sworn in, when a camera captured Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan promising profanely to impeach Mr. Trump as she drew cheers from liberal activists at a celebration at a bar near the Capitol. By the time Mr. Trump discussed the matter directly in a news conference in the Rose Garden on Friday afternoon, weeks of speculation about his potential peril had burst into the open. Republicans, eager to portray Democrats as out to destroy Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, piled on criticism of Ms. Tlaib \u2014 some of it racially tinged. (Ms. Tlaib, who is Palestinian-American, is one of the first Muslims in Congress. The Christian Broadcasting Network referred to her as a \u201cfoul-mouthed Islamic congresswoman.\u201d) Democratic leaders, who view discussion of impeachment as politically dangerous and premature, offered worried words meant to tamp down speculation about their intentions. Perhaps out of a belief that an impeachment fight would help him politically \u2014 as it did President Bill Clinton in the 1990s \u2014 or outright fear that newly empowered Democrats actually might threaten his presidency, Mr. Trump dived into the conversation head first. \u201cWe even talked about that today,\u201d he told reporters in the Rose Garden, referring to an exchange with Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a meeting earlier Friday to try to negotiate an end to the shutdown of the government, which Mr. Trump threatened to keep closed for years if he did not get money from Congress for a wall on the southern border. \u201cI said, Why don\u2019t you use this for impeachment? And Nancy said, We\u2019re not looking to impeach you.\u201d Senior aides to Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats in the room disputed that characterization. The president had indeed invoked Ms. Tlaib and other House Democrats who want to impeach him, they said, but Ms. Pelosi tried to shift the meeting back to its intended topic and did not offer the president reassurances. \u201cIn his opening comments at the meeting, President Trump brought up impeachment,\u201d Ms. Pelosi\u2019s spokesman, Drew Hammill, wrote on Twitter. \u201cSpeaker Pelosi made clear that today\u2019s meeting was about re-opening government, not impeachment.\u201d Regardless, Mr. Trump\u2019s frank embrace of the issue was another astonishing development: a president of the United States talking openly about his potential impeachment at a White House news conference. Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had asked on Twitter, \u201cHow do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time? \u201d He continued the theme at his news conference by asserting that \u201cyou can\u2019t impeach somebody who is doing a great job.\u201d Ms. Pelosi and senior Democrats said they were determined not to take the bait for now and risk generating a backlash from Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, who would most likely see impeachment as the overreaction of out-of-control Democrats. But the words of Ms. Tlaib, who stood by her comments on Friday, made evident the pressure already mounting from the left, where public opinion polls suggest a majority of liberals want the president removed from office. \u201cPeople love you and you win,\u201d Ms. Tlaib told the crowd Thursday night. \u201cAnd when your son looks at you and says: \u2019Momma, look, you won. Bullies don\u2019t win.\u2019 And I said, \u2019Baby, they don\u2019t.\u2019 Because we\u2019re going to go in there, and we\u2019re going to impeach the motherfucker.\u201d She made no apologies for the remark on Friday, proclaiming that \u201cI will always speak truth to power\u201d and fashioning her own hashtag, #unapologeticallyme. She told a Detroit television station that \u201cit\u2019s probably exactly how my grandmother, if she was alive, would say it.\u201d Her outburst ran counter to all Democratic talking points. Ms. Pelosi and her deputies have repeatedly made the case that it is too early to consider impeachment. Even as Mr. Trump\u2019s legal perils have deepened \u2014 and federal prosecutors in New York appear to have gathered evidence implicating him in a campaign finance crime \u2014 Democrats have said they want to wait to see the findings of an investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, of the president, his campaign and Russia\u2019s attempts to interfere in the 2016 election. \u201cI don\u2019t really like that kind of language,\u201d Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee \u2014 where any impeachment inquiry must begin \u2014 said on CNN. \u201cBut more to the point, I disagree with what she said. It is too early to talk about that intelligently. We have to follow the facts.\u201d Ms. Pelosi defended Ms. Tlaib on Friday at a town hall hosted by MSNBC at the speaker\u2019s alma mater in Washington, Trinity University. \u201cI\u2019m not in the censorship business,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach executive branch officials for \u201ctreason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d but what constitutes such crimes has traditionally been defined by the majority party of the House. A vote to impeach takes a simple majority in the House, but a two-thirds vote is needed in the Senate to convict and remove an official from office. Mr. Nadler, Ms. Pelosi and other party elders believe Mr. Trump is threatening the country\u2019s democratic institutions. Privately, many harbor suspicions that he obstructed justice, collaborated with the Russians in 2016 or both. But they also argue that an impeachment that does not have a reasonable shot of winning a conviction in the Senate will backfire and strengthen Mr. Trump in the 2020 campaign. In the meantime, they are planning to open multiple investigations into accusations of wrongdoing around the president, his campaign and his administration. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn\u2019t avoid impeachment for a political reason,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll just have to see how it comes.\u201d Republicans ignored the distinction. \u201cIs this the behavior that we are going to find with this new majority party in Congress?\u201d Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, asked at a news conference. He repeatedly singled out Ms. Pelosi, asking why she had not censured Ms. Tlaib. Mr. Trump was similarly critical of Ms. Tlaib. \u201cI thought her comments were disgraceful,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the news conference. \u201cI think she dishonored herself, and I think she dishonored her family.\u201d He added that her comments were \u201cdisrespectful to the United States of America.\u201d Ms. Tlaib is far from alone among House Democrats. Representatives Brad Sherman of California and Al Green of Texas formally introduced an article of impeachment on Thursday, charging that Mr. Trump had obstructed justice in firing James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director. Others are expected to follow. \u201cI continue to believe that obstruction of justice is the clearest, simplest and most provable high crime and misdemeanor committed by Donald J. Trump,\u201d Mr. Sherman said in a statement. \u201cI hope that the articles of impeachment are the subject of hearings before the Judiciary Committee early in 2019.\u201d Many of Ms. Tlaib\u2019s new colleagues expressed sympathy for her sentiments, even as they said the House should proceed differently. \u201cDonald Trump is going to be impeached whether it is by the ballot box or Congress,\u201d said Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California and a member of the Intelligence Committee. \u201cIt will just be a matter of which one comes first.\u201d But, Mr. Swalwell added, Democrats need to avoid making \u201ca martyr\u201d out of Mr. Trump by affording him \u201ca fairer investigation than he deserves.\u201d",

        "body": " Chris Christie Announces He's Running For President In 2016 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) announced he's running for president in 2016. Christie told supporters of his plans in a phone call Tuesday morning, according to NBC and the AP. Christie made a public announcement Tuesday afternoon at Livingston High School, his alma mater, in Livingston, New Jersey. \"I am now ready to fight for the people of the United States of America,\" Christie said at the public announcement. He praised his home state during his speech, sharing how working as governor inspired him to run for president. Christie also took hits at lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, claiming a lack of productivity from Congress is giving Americans anxiety. \"Both parties have failed our country... both parties have led us to believe that America, a country that was built on compromise -- that compromise is somehow a dirty word,\" Christie said. \"We need to have the courage to choose, we need to have the courage to stand up and say 'enough,'\" Christie added. Christie, a tough-talking former federal prosecutor whose reputation for political bullying was reinforced by a George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal last year, has served as New Jersey governor since January 2010, winning election twice in a state where Democrats greatly outnumber Republicans. He notably led the state during catastrophic damage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Christie's favorability rating among voters skyrocketed after he made himself visible through interviews, press conferences and tours of storm damage during the disaster. Christie focused on his state rather than the presidential election that took place days after New Jersey's shore was ravaged by the storm. HuffPost reported in November 2012 Christie turned down an invitation to appear at an event with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney days ahead of the election. Instead, Christie was seen that October praising President Barack Obama for responsiveness and \"leadership\" in the storm's aftermath. In an October 2012 interview with Fox News, Christie said he didn't \"give a damn about presidential politics\" in the wake of the storm. \"I have got a job to do here in New Jersey that is much bigger than presidential politics. And I could care less about any of that stuff,\" Christie said. Christie was elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association in November 2013. He worked within that role to raise money and contribute to the campaigns of Republican governors across the U.S., many of whom won in the 2014 midterm elections. While serving as chair of the governors association, Christie held prep sessions on foreign policy with officials, business leaders and academics in an attempt to ready himself for a White House run, according The Associated Press. Known for his blunt speaking style, Christie has acknowledged that he can come off brash and confrontational. \"I'm not everybody's cup of tea, but I'm not in this business to get elected to prom king. My job is to lead, and that's what I try to do,\" Christie said in 2014, according to the AP. His image suffered a major blow in 2014, when it was revealed members of his administration, including his deputy chief of staff, were involved in a plot to cause traffic jams near the George Washington Bridge to retaliate against a mayor who hadn't supported Christie's 2013 re-election. Dubbed \"Bridgegate,\" the controversy caused Christie, who had enjoyed high favorability ratings, to see his negatives rise sharply. Christie has also faced criticism for reversinghis position recently on Common Core education standards. Christie initially supported the standards but said recently that he no longer supports them because of how they've played out in his state. According to HuffPost Pollster, Christie is in the middle of the pack of GOP presidential candidates.",

        "body": " Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, sharply criticized her sister\u2019s stance on same-sex marriage and urged her own Facebook friends to share the message. Posting on Facebook on Friday evening, Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her longtime partner last year, wrote: \u201cFor the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage.\u201d Their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage, and the younger Cheney echoed some of his language on the issue when she added, \u201cFreedom means freedom for everyone.\u201d \u201cThat means that all families \u2014 regardless of how they look or how they are made \u2014 all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other,\u201d Mary Cheney wrote. Earlier Friday, Liz Cheney revealed her position on same-sex marriage, a topic she has kept relatively quiet about since declaring her candidacy in July against incumbent Senator Mike Enzi, Republican of Wyoming. \u201cI am not pro-gay marriage,\u201d Liz Cheney said in a statement responding to an apparent push poll against her in Wyoming. \u201cI believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states, and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.\u201d That position \u2014 deferring to the will of the voters on a state-by-state basis \u2014 may represent something of a compromise between total support or opposition. But it did little to placate her sister. \u201cIt\u2019s not something to be decided by a show of hands,\u201d Mary Cheney wrote. And to emphasize that she was not shying away from drawing attention to her view, Mary Cheney concluded her Facebook post: \u201cPlease like and share if you agree.\u201d In an e-mail, Mary Cheney declined to comment further on her sister\u2019s position, saying she would let her Facebook post speak for itself. The Cheney family dispute mirrors the broader disagreement among Republicans on same-sex marriage. Less than a decade after George W. Bush and Dick Cheney won re-election in part thanks to conservative enthusiasm over enshrining traditional marriage into law, some in the party believe they are losing voters, particularly younger ones, over an issue on which public opinion has changed rapidly. But other Republicans believe traditional marriage is a pillar of family values, and in some cases are reluctant to abandon their social conservative base on the issue. Liz Cheney\u2019s stance underlines the degree to which full-throated support for same-sex marriage, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming, still poses a political risk in a Republican primary. Mr. Enzi opposes legalizing same-sex marriage.",

        "body": " WASHINGTON \u2014 A young Republican congressional aide resigned Monday after her Facebook post berating President Obama\u2019s daughters for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon became a sensation on the Internet. On Friday, the aide, Elizabeth Lauten, 31, who has more than 14,000 followers on Twitter as @DCGopGirl and at the time was a spokeswoman for a little-known congressman from Tennessee, wrote an open letter to Sasha and Malia Obama on her Facebook page, saying they should \u201ctry showing a little class\u201d and \u201cdress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.\u201d By Monday, Ms. Lauten had resigned as communications director to Representative Stephen Fincher, a farmer and gospel singer perhaps best known for his whimsically named hometown, Frog Jump. Ms. Lauten, now a footnote in Mr. Fincher\u2019s career, is the latest cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping directed at the country\u2019s most famous offspring. It started Wednesday with the most innocuous of events: the annual naming of the National Thanksgiving Turkey, when Mr. Obama officially liberated Cheese, a large white bird with impressive plumage, from the Thursday dinner table. Per tradition, the first daughters were in attendance, this time wearing mostly cheerless expressions and short outfits. Malia, 16, was dressed in a plaid miniskirt, sweater, dark tights and black hiking-style boots. Sasha, 13, wore a maroon dress, a cardigan sweater, a pair of white midcalf-high socks and black ankle boots. At times, the girls gazed glumly at the floor and threw an occasional eye roll at their father as he compared pardoning Cheese to granting amnesty to unauthorized immigrants. \u201cYou want to pet him?\u201d Mr. Obama asked his daughters. \u201cNah,\u201d Malia said quickly. Their teenage disdain drew its fair share of media attention, including a BuzzFeed article titled \u201cThe Obama Girls Could Not Be More Bored by Their Dad\u2019s Jokes.\u201d Enter Ms. Lauten \u2014 a former Republican National Committee new media aide who describes herself on Twitter as loving God, cats, the Daughters of the American Revolution \u201c& all things pink, green and pearls!\u201d \u2014 whose commentary had a sharper edge. \u201cI get you\u2019re both in those awful teen years, but you\u2019re a part of the First Family, try showing a little class,\u201d she wrote above a picture of the unenthused Obama daughters. \u201cAt least respect the part you play.\u201d She went on to say that Malia and Sasha were \u201ccoming up a little short in the \u2018good role model\u2019 department\u201d because their parents \u201cdon\u2019t respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter.\u201d Ms. Lauten wrote what she thought the daughters should have done: \u201cRise to the occasion. Act like being in the White House matters to you. Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.\u201d Her views were widely circulated and eventually posted on Twitter by a reporter for The Root, a news, opinion and culture site aimed at African-American audiences. A flood of angry responses quickly followed. Ms. Lauten, who did not respond to repeated requests for further comment, later posted an apology for her \u201churtful\u201d words, saying she had \u201cjudged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager.\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Monday that he was \u201ctaken aback that there was some political operative on Capitol Hill who did use the occasion of a Thanksgiving-themed event to criticize members of the first family.\u201d Patti Davis, the daughter of Ronald Reagan, could relate. In a letter to Sasha and Malia posted on her website, Ms. Davis recalled being criticized by a reporter decades ago for the outfit she wore to a cocktail reception her parents held for Queen Elizabeth II when Mr. Reagan was president. \u201cAs First Daughters, you can\u2019t win,\u201d Ms. Davis wrote. \u201cAnd while there isn\u2019t anything normal about the life you are living right now, you still can be.\u201d",

        "body": " A day after telling reporters that he's \"not going to talk about this anymore,\" Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) broke his silence Wednesday about the controversy surrounding a lewd photo sent from his Twitter account. \"This was a circumstance where someone committed a prank on the internet,\" he told MSNBC's Luke Russert. \"I didn't send [that] picture out\" the congressman said, though he does not know who did. Is the photo of him? I can't say with certitude\" he told Russert. \"It was a prank,\" Weiner reiterated. \"This is not a national security matter. We're not making a federal case out of this.\" \"I'm not sure it rises -- no pun intended -- to that level,\" he continued. Weiner said he has hired a private security company to investigate how his account has been hacked. Last weekend, a lewd photo of a man's bulging underpants was sent to a 21-year-old female college student in Seattle from Weiner's Twitter account. It was quickly deleted, but a frenzy of coverage and comment ensued on blogs, cable news outlets and other media. Weiner's spokesman said that the congressman's Twitter account had been hacked and dismissed the episode as a prank, but this week the congressman hired a lawyer, prompting additional rumors to swirl. Earlier this week, the colorful and sometimes combative congressman who represents parts of Brooklyn and Queens was characteristically sharp tongued, refusing to answer reporters' questions about it, and even calling one a \"jackass\" for interrupting him. He insisted that he wanted to move on from the incident, which was distracting from his work on Capitol Hill. But there was no sign the story, or the speculation about who may have been responsible for tweeting the photo, was fading. Weiner failed in a 2005 bid for the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York City, but he is still is widely considered a future contender for the office. \"I'm not going to talk about this anymore,\" Weiner told reporters on Capitol Hill. \"I think that if I was giving a speech to 45,000 people and someone stood up and heckled in the back, I wouldn't spend three days talking to him. I'm going to get back to the conversation I care about.\" Weiner declined to answer reporters' questions about the photo or why he was hiring a lawyer for the case instead of having law enforcement officials pursue the matter. Weiner was a Twitter follower of the female college student who received the photo. The tweet of the lewd photo first was reported Saturday by BigGovernment.com, a website run by conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart. The site said the photo was tweeted to a female college student in Seattle. The woman told the New York Daily News that she had never met Weiner, and that there had \"never been any inappropriate exchanges\" between her and the congressman. Weiner, 46, is married to Huma Abedin, an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The congressman over the weekend joked about the incident on Twitter, asking whether his kitchen blender would be next to \"attack\" him. On Tuesday as the House was preparing to vote on the nation's debt limit, Weiner was back tweeting about the vote with his usual partisan edge.",

        "body": " Paul Ryan went on offense Tuesday in response to criticism over his Medicare plan, using an interview with Fox News coupled with a new TV ad to claim President Obama\u2019s health care plan treats the treasured entitlement like a \u201cpiggy bank,\u201d while the \u201cRomney-Ryan\u201d plan preserves it. Ryan, in his first one-on-one interview since being named Saturday as Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate, told Fox News on Tuesday he thinks Medicare can be a winning issue for their campaign. \"We're the ones who are offering a plan to save Medicare, to protect Medicare, to strengthen Medicare,\" Ryan said. \"We're the ones who are not raiding Medicare to pay for ObamaCare. \u2026 We're the ones continuing the guarantee of Medicare for people in or near retirement.\" He added: \u201cPresident Obama is actually damaging Medicare for current seniors. It's irrefutable and that's why I think this is a debate we want to have, and that's the debate we're going to win.\u201d The comments signal Ryan and Romney are prepared to dig in and fight back, as Democrats lob charges that Ryan stands for \u201cending Medicare as we know it.\u201d The Obama campaign used that line Monday in a Web video timed for Romney\u2019s arrival in Florida, with its large senior population. The video pointed to Ryan\u2019s budget proposals, which include significant changes to Medicare. The Romney campaign retorted with an ad of its own Tuesday. The ad says: \u201cYou paid in to Medicare for years \u2026 now when you need it, Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare. Why? To pay for ObamaCare.\u201d Ryan told Fox News the campaign is trying to show the \u201cclear contrast\u201d between what Republicans propose and what Obama\u2019s health care law does. Ryan wants to make changes to Medicare for those retiring a decade from now but leave benefits for current retirees and those retiring soon in place. \u201cThey turned Medicare into a piggy bank to finance ObamaCare,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cAnd we want to point that out. And we want to \u2026 restore those cuts to prevent that raid. \u2026 And so we propose no changes to anybody in or near retirement so that the guarantee of Medicare is for them. That's a clear contrast with President Obama's plan.\u201d The Obama campaign is disputing that argument. Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith described the new Romney-Ryan ad on the subject as \u201cdishonest and hypocritical,\u201d considering Ryan\u2019s own proposals for Medicare. \u201cThe savings his ad attacks do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit, and Mitt Romney embraced the very same savings when he promised he\u2019d sign Paul Ryan\u2019s budget,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBecause the president is eliminating subsidies to insurance companies and cutting waste and fraud, we\u2019ve extended the life of Medicare by eight years. The truth is that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it: people with Medicare would be left with nothing but a voucher in place of the guaranteed benefits they rely on today.\u201d Both sides are being selective in how they describe each other\u2019s plans. The Ryan proposal, submitted again in the House earlier this year, would a decade from now give seniors government payments to purchase private plans or stay within the current system. Ryan says this is to preserve Medicare, not \u201cend\u201d it, as Obama\u2019s campaign claims. But while Ryan slams the health care overhaul for cutting Medicare, even he acknowledged that his own plan achieves \u201csavings\u201d for Medicare in the long run. Though he doesn\u2019t use the word \u201ccuts,\u201d the plan would slow the rate of benefit growth for seniors according to the Congressional Budget Office. And the ObamaCare cuts he referenced would likely come in the form of lower payments to providers. A Romney campaign aide, though, said \u201cthat\u2019s a distinction without a difference\u201d since the \u201cprovider passes that reduction along to\u201d patients. In his interview with Fox News, Ryan also hammered Obama for what he called his \u201cutter failure when it comes to creating jobs.\u201d Amplifying the Romney campaign message, he said Obama\u2019s heavy borrowing is dragging down economic growth \u2013 he also claimed the \u201chope and change campaign of '08 has become the blame and attack campaign of 2012.\u201d Ryan offered new insight as well on how Romney and Ryan came to bond in the months before he was announced as running mate. He recalled when he was campaigning with Romney earlier this year ahead of the Wisconsin primary. \u201cWe spent about five days on the road, five working hour or so days,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in between all of those stops, driving from, you know, Appleton to Green Bay to Janesville to Milwaukee, we got to know each other. We conversed on policy issues, on where to take the country. And sooner or later, we basically started sharing the microphones at these town hall meetings and we just kind of developed a chemistry with one another and a mutual understanding with each other.\u201d Ryan said he doesn\u2019t know whether he had a \u201cspecial place\u201d but it was \u201cvery clear we thought the same on these issues.\u201d \u201cWhen he asked me to join the ticket, he basically said to me, 'You share my values and you have the kind of experience that could be a complement to my experience to getting this country back on track, to creating jobs, to getting people back to work, to saving this country from a debt crisis,'\" Ryan said. Ryan also discussed his affection for novelist Ayn Rand, saying \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d triggered his interest in economics. He said he doesn\u2019t share her overall philosophy but said her books \u201cshowed how the pitfalls of socialism can hurt the economy.\u201d Obama, meanwhile, took on Ryan for the second straight day Tuesday, using a stop in Oskaloosa, Iowa, to criticize Ryan\u2019s and Romney\u2019s tax plan. \u201cYou may have heard that Governor Romney just chose his running mate, Congressman Ryan. He's a good man. He's a family man. He's the ideological leader of the Republicans in Congress,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd he's an articulate spokesperson for Governor Romney's views. The problem is, those views are wrong.\u201d",

        "body": " President Trump said he was preparing an executive order that would nullify the long-accepted constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship in the United States, his latest attention-grabbing maneuver days before midterm congressional elections as he has sought to activate his base by vowing to clamp down on immigrants and immigration. \u201cWe\u2019re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years, with all of those benefits,\u201d Mr. Trump told Axios during an interview that was released in part on Tuesday, making a false claim. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s ridiculous. And it has to end.\u201d In fact, at least 30 other countries, including Canada, Mexico and many others in the Western Hemisphere, grant automatic birthright citizenship, according to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that supports restricting immigration and whose work Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers often cite. But Mr. Trump\u2019s plan met with swift pushback from some even in his own party on Tuesday. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who is retiring, said in an interview that the president \u201cobviously\u201d cannot eviscerate birthright citizenship by executive order. \u201cYou obviously cannot do that,\u201d Ryan told WVLK, a radio station in Lexington, Ky. \u201cI\u2019m a believer in following the plain text of the Constitution, and I think in this case, the 14th Amendment is pretty clear, and that would involve a very, very lengthy constitutional process.\u201d Mr. Ryan compared the idea of doing so to Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 action to grant work permits and deportation reprieves to some undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, which Republicans, including Mr. Trump, vociferously protested as a naked abuse of presidential power. Doing away with birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants was an idea Mr. Trump pitched as a presidential candidate, but there is no clear indication that he would be able to do so unilaterally, and attempting to would be certain to prompt legal challenges. The consensus among legal scholars is that he cannot, but Mr. Trump and his allies are eager to test it in the Supreme Court. \u201cWe all cherish the language of the 14th Amendment, but the Supreme Court of the United States has never ruled on whether the language of the 14th Amendment \u2014 \u2019subject to the jurisdiction thereof\u2019 \u2014 applies specifically to people who are in the country illegally,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence told Politico in an interview on Tuesday, several hours after Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were reported. It is likewise unknown how serious Mr. Trump is about taking the action. In recent days, with the approach of the midterm balloting in which Republican control of Congress is at risk, he has sought to appeal to voters by making other dramatic claims that appear to have no chance of materializing, such as imminent action to grant a 10 percent tax cut for the middle class. To accomplish the idea he floated on Tuesday, Mr. Trump would have to find a way around the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which states, \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d The amendment means that any child born in the United States is considered a citizen. Amendments to the Constitution cannot be overridden by presidential action \u2014 they can be changed or undone only by overwhelming majorities in Congress or the states, with a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress or through a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of state legislatures. Some conservatives have long made the argument that the 14th Amendment was meant to apply only to citizens and legal permanent residents, not immigrants who are present in the country without authorization. In an opinion piece in The Washington Post this year, Michael Anton, a former spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s National Security Council, said birthright citizenship was based on a misreading of the amendment, and of an 1898 Supreme Court ruling that he argued pertained only to the children of legal residents. \u201cThe notion that simply being born within the geographical limits of the United States automatically confers U.S. citizenship is an absurdity \u2014 historically, constitutionally, philosophically and practically,\u201d Mr. Anton wrote in July. \u201cAn executive order could specify to federal agencies that the children of noncitizens are not citizens.\u201d Mr. Trump told Axios that while he initially believed he needed a constitutional amendment or action by Congress to make the change, the White House Counsel\u2019s Office has advised him otherwise. \u201cNow they\u2019re saying I can do it just with an executive order,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for clarification of the legal grounds the president\u2019s lawyers have given him for validating such a move. His discussion of the idea comes after the administration announced it was streaming more than 5,000 active-duty troops to the southern border, part of an election-season rash of executive action Mr. Trump has undertaken as he works to energize his anti-immigrant base. It also follows action by the Trump administration to try to discourage legal immigrants from using public benefits through a new federal rule that would deny green card status to people who use social safety net services, like food assistance and Medicaid. The proposal provoked outrage among civil rights groups, a response that Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have argued privately is a central objective of many of the president\u2019s most aggressive proposals on immigration and other matters. Jess Morales Rocketto, the chairwoman of Families Belong Together, an immigrant advocacy group, called the idea \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, called the idea illegal and offensive. \u201cAside from being unconstitutional, such an executive order would exacerbate racial tensions, exploit fears and drive further polarization across the country at a moment that calls for the promotion of unity and inclusion,\u201d Ms. Clarke said in a statement. \u201cThe letter and spirit of the Fourteenth Amendment places those born in this country on equal footing, and an executive order that strips away citizenship would create a permanent group of second-class citizens and invite litigation.\u201d Some Republicans also rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion, an indication of the political risks for the party that attend the president\u2019s bid to stoke anti-immigrant sentiment in advance of next Tuesday\u2019s voting. \u201cThe President is wrong to end #BirthrightCitizenship,\u201d Bob Hugin, a Republican candidate for Senate in New Jersey, said in a Twitter post. \u201cWe\u2019re a nation of immigrants made better by the diversity of its people, especially in NJ. We need compassionate comprehensive immigration reform now.\u201d A 1898 Supreme Court decision held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese parents residing in the United States, was a citizen because of his birth on American soil. Mr. Anton argued in The Post that because his parents were legal residents, the ruling should not be read as an affirmation of the status of children of undocumented immigrants. But immigration advocates argue that scrapping the concept of birthright citizenship would do away with a vital principle, and would be counterproductive to the stated goals of those who, like Mr. Trump, rail routinely against illegal immigration. According to a study by the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan group, if citizenship were denied to every child with at least one unauthorized parent, the unauthorized population in the United States would reach 24 million by 2050 \u2014 more than double what it is now. Stephen Legomsky, a Washington University School of Law professor and former chief counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the 14th Amendment\u2019s application to the children of undocumented immigrants was a matter of pure common sense. \u201cLike anyone else, native-born Americans, whoever their parents are, can be charged with crimes if they disobey U.S. law,\u201d Mr. Legomsky said. \u201cHow would this be possible if the U.S. had no jurisdiction over them?\u201d",

Moore, after a report that he had made sexual advances toward four teenage girls when he was in his 30s. The Washington Post reported that, in early 1979, Mr. Moore, then a district attorney and later the chief justice of the state Supreme Court, had approached a 14-year-old, eventually kissing her, undressing her, touching her over her bra and underpants, and guiding her hand to touch him over his underwear. The paper found three other women who said they had been pursued by Mr. Moore around the same time, when they were between 16 and 18 years old. The Post interviewed more than 30 people in reporting its account. Mr. Moore told The Post that the allegations were \u201ccompletely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign.\u201d He is set to face Doug Jones, a Democrat, in a special election next month. The story was met with immediate backlash from Republicans in Alabama, several of whom dismissed the women\u2019s stories out of hand. Some called the article a partisan plot, even as the reporters behind it described in detail how they had uncovered the story and corroborated the allegations. Here are some of the officials\u2019 responses. \u2018Total contrived media garbage\u2019 That\u2019s how John Skipper, 66, a former chairman of the Mobile County Republican Party, characterized the claims, speaking to The New York Times. He said that he and other Alabama Republicans would continue to support their candidate and echoed Mr. Moore\u2019s assertion that the Democratic Party had been behind the story. \u201cMost of them will not be shocked,\u201d he said, \u201cand will rather be expecting these shenanigans being pulled by the Democrats as standard operating procedure.\u201d Alabama\u2019s state auditor, Jim Ziegler, told The Washington Examiner that the women\u2019s claims were \u201cmuch ado about nothing\u201d and said that Mr. Moore had done nothing \u201cimmoral or illegal.\u201d (Alabama law, both in 1979 and now, finds that someone who is 19 or older and has sexual contact with someone between the ages of 12 and 16 is guilty of second-degree sex abuse.) Mr. Ziegler sought to justify Mr. Moore\u2019s actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph, saying, \u201cMary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus.\u201d \u201cIf they believe this man is predatory, they are guilty of allowing him to exist for 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI think someone should prosecute and go after them. You can\u2019t be a victim 40 years later, in my opinion.\u201d Daniel Dale, a reporter for The Toronto Star, contacted multiple Republican officials in the state and kept a running report of their responses to the story. Jerry Pow, the party chairman for Bibb County, told Mr. Dale that he\u2019d back Mr. Moore even if the candidate had committed a sex crime. \u201cI would vote for Judge Moore because I wouldn\u2019t want to vote for Doug,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I support what he did.\u201d Others, including the party chairmen for Covington County, William Blocker, and Mobile County, John Skipper, dismissed the story as a Democratic trick. Mr. Blocker said that he would not change his mind even if there was proof that Mr. Moore was guilty. Riley Seibenhener, the party chairman in Geneva County, told Mr. Dale that if the allegations were true, he would not support the candidate. But he also said that Mr. Moore was not guilty of \u201cforcible rape.\u201d \u201cI know that 14-year-olds dont\u2019t make good decisions,\u201d he said.",

Lieberman, 75, who served in the Senate from 1989-2013, first as a Democrat and then as an independent, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday afternoon to discuss leading the law enforcement agency. A late and somewhat unlikely addition to Trump's short list, Lieberman is nonetheless the sudden frontrunner. When asked point-blank by a reporter in the Oval Office Thursday if Lieberman was the leading contender, Trump replied, \"Yes.\" Trump also met Wednesday with current acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and FBI official Richard McFeely. Lieberman\u2019s law enforcement experience stems from his two-term tenure as Connecticut\u2019s attorney general, spanning from 1983 until his resignation in 1989 when he was elected to the U.S. Senate. Lieberman, who ran as vice president on Al Gore's 2000 ticket, became an independent after losing the Democratic primary in 2006. He won re-election, and two years later further angered Democrats when he endorsed John McCain for president against eventual winner Barack Obama, even speaking at the Republican National Convention. Lieberman told Fox Business Network last year that he \u201cnever changed parties\u201d and in fact ended up endorsing Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign against Trump. Some Republican senators called the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey \u201cintriguing,\u201d but Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said it was a \u201cmistake\u201d to nominate him. \"Lieberman is probably the only person who can get 100 votes in the Senate,\" Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said on Capitol Hill on Thursday after the closed Senate briefing with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Cornyn was on the White House's shortlist to replace Comey, but withdrew himself from consideration this week. On Thursday morning on the Senate floor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., argued against a \u201ccareer politician\u201d of either party to lead the FBI, though he did not name Lieberman.",

Trump slams 'crooked' Hillary aide Huma, calls on 'Deep State' DOJ to act President Trump went after \"Crooked\" Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin on Tuesday, appearing to call on the \u201cDeep State\u201d Justice Department to look at potential security issues in her handling of classified material after a recent email dump. \u201cCrooked Hillary Clinton\u2019s top aide, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on the submarine? Jail!\u201d Trump tweeted early Tuesday. \u201cDeep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others.\u201d Trump was referring to U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was put in prison for taking unauthorized photos inside a nuclear submarine. He seemed to suggest a double standard is at play, compared with the lack of punishment for Clinton and her aides. The president\u2019s tweet comes after the State Department, in a Friday news dump, released a batch of emails from Abedin\u2019s account that were discovered by the FBI on a laptop belonging to her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner. At least four of the documents were marked \u201cclassified.\u201d Abedin also forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo email account before every Yahoo account was hacked, first reported by the Daily Caller. Abedin also sent passwords for her government laptop to her Yahoo account on Aug. 24, 2009. In 2013, Yahoo was hacked, and the company said in a statement that \u201call Yahoo user accounts were affected\u201d by the theft. Former FBI Director James Comey, who led the Clinton email investigation, said during a congressional hearing last year that he believed Abedin forwarded emails to Weiner for him to print out so that she could give them to Clinton. Abedin\u2019s emails shook the 2016 presidential race, as Comey told Congress on Oct. 28, 2016, just days before the election, that the FBI had found more of Clinton\u2019s messages on Weiner\u2019s laptop as they investigated a sexting case against him. The discovery of those records reopened the case against Clinton, several months after Comey said he wasn\u2019t recommending any charges be filed in the case.

        "body": " PHOENIX \u2014 As the Arizona Legislature sent a bill to her desk Monday that would grant business owners the right to invoke religion to refuse service to gays and others, Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, faced pressure from many corners to veto the measure, which has cast unwanted national attention on Arizona. Elected officials, civic leaders and business groups spoke out publicly against the measure, which passed both houses of the Legislature on Thursday. On Twitter, Arizona\u2019s United States senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, also Republicans, had nearly identical posts, with both of them saying they hoped Ms. Brewer would veto the bill. An executive from Apple Inc., which plans to build a big manufacturing plant in Mesa, called Ms. Brewer to urge her to reject it, and W. Douglas Parker, chairman and chief executive of American Airlines, sent her a letter citing the state\u2019s \u201ceconomic comeback\u201d and saying, \u201cThere is genuine concern throughout the business community that this bill, if signed into law, would jeopardize all that has been accomplished so far.\u201d Their calls were echoed by three Republican state senators \u2014 Adam Driggs, Steve Pierce and Bob Worsley, all members of the party\u2019s conservative camp \u2014 who had helped pass the legislation in the first place. \u201cWhile our sincere intent in voting for this bill was to create a shield for all citizens\u2019 religious liberties, the bill has instead been mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword of religious intolerance,\u201d the senators said in a letter to Ms. Brewer, adding that the matter was \u201ccausing our state immeasurable harm.\u201d The bill\u2019s remaining supporters took to the airwaves and the Internet to defend it. Cathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy, an architect of the bill, issued a news release calling attacks on the legislation \u201cpolitics at its absolute worse,\u201d and saying, \u201cInstead of having an honest discussion about the true meaning of religious liberty, opponents of the bill have hijacked this discussion through lies, personal attacks, and irresponsible reporting.\u201d Ms. Brewer was in Washington on Monday but was scheduled to return Tuesday to Phoenix, where she will have until the end of the week to act on the bill. Her spokesman, Andrew Wilder, suggested that she would not take that long, but he would not say what she was inclined to do. The religion bill comes as Arizona prepares to host the Super Bowl next year and struggles to regain its economic vitality. From Washington on Monday, Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a Democrat, told Ronan Farrow of MSNBC that if Ms. Brewer signs the measure, \u201cthe N.F.L. may be looking, or maybe should be looking, to move the Super Bowl out of the state.\u201d And Barry Broome, president and chief executive of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, said that leaders of four companies looking to relocate to Arizona had put his organization on notice, saying they might reconsider if the bill became law. The state\u2019s image is still scarred by a divisive immigration law passed in 2010, which gave police officers the ability to stop people whom they suspected of being in the country illegally, and triggered widespread boycotts. Among the Republicans vying to succeed Ms. Brewer, who cannot run for re-election because of term limits, there was broad consensus against the measure, which would expand the state\u2019s definition of \u201cexercise of religion\u201d to protect businesses and citizens from lawsuits after denying services on religious grounds. One candidate, Scott Smith, the mayor of Mesa, who is a Mormon, said that the bill \u201cgives carte blanche for anybody to discriminate under the guise of religion.\u201d Another candidate, Doug Ducey, the state treasurer, qualified his view, saying that he would veto the bill but then \u201cbring together all the interested parties before this legislative session adjourns to forge consensus on acceptable language protecting religious liberty.\u201d Mr. Wilder, the governor\u2019s spokesman, said Ms. Brewer\u2019s office had received more than 10,000 calls and emails on the matter as of Monday morning.",

        "body": " The NAACP adopted a resolution Tuesday condemning \"racist elements\" in the Tea Party movement and calling on the movement's leaders to repudiate bigotry, despite claims from Tea Partiers that the measure is just a political ploy. The nation's leading civil rights group took up the language at its annual convention in Kansas City, Mo. The resolution initially said the NAACP would \"repudiate the racism of the Tea Parties\" and stand against the movement's attempt to \"push our country back to the pre-civil rights era,\" though the wording was amended to downplay criticism of all Tea Partiers while asking them to repudiate bigots in their own ranks. \"We take no issue with the Tea Party movement. We believe in freedom of assembly and people raising their voices in a democracy,\" the NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said in a written statement announcing the unanimous vote. \"What we take issue with is the Tea Party's continued tolerance for bigotry and bigoted statements. \"The time has come for them to accept the responsibility that comes with influence and make clear there is no place for racism and anti-Semitism, homophobia and other forms of bigotry in their movement.\" NAACP leaders have referenced an incident in March when Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers on Capitol Hill ahead of a health care vote. But Tea Party members have challenged claims that their activists accosted black lawmakers in March and no visual evidence has been produced depicting a racist attack. Dallas Tea Party founder Phillip Dennis said \"there was no proof\" of racist behavior at the event and that the movement welcomes minority members. \"We don't care about the pigment of one's skin,\" he said. Dennis accused the NAACP of playing the \"race card\" and called the organization \"irrelevant.\" The nearby St. Louis Tea Party had an all-hands-on-deck response to the NAACP's plan. The group has drafted a resolution of its own condemning the civil rights group for reducing itself to a \"bigoted\" and \"partisan attack dog organization.\" Debate was mostly closed to the public, but the final version \"calls on the tea party and all people of good will to repudiate the racist element and activities within the tea party,\" said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau. The final wording won't be released until the NAACP's national board of directors approves the resolution during its meeting in October. But the original called for the NAACP to \"educate its membership and the community that this movement is not just about higher taxes and limited government.\" It said something could evolve \"and become more dangerous for that small percentage of people that really think our country has been taken away from them.\" In a matter of hours, the St. Louis group fired off to the NAACP the statement demanding the organization withdraw its \"bigoted, false and inflammatory\" resolution. The missive accused the NAACP of resorting to political tactics and urged the IRS to reconsider whether it can continue to qualify for tax-exempt status. Tea Party organizers routinely defend themselves against charges of racism, disavowing racially charged signs that appear in their protest crowds and provide fodder for Tea Party critics. The NAACP resolution, first reported by the Kansas City Star, was expected to make reference to the March incident on Capitol Hill. St. Louis Tea Party organizer Bill Hennessy wrote on the group's website Tuesday that the Tea Party stands for smaller government and fiscal responsibility, and accused the NAACP of abandoning black America. \"When you look at the crime and poverty and family breakdown of the African-American community ... you see a half-century of failure by the NAACP,\" he wrote. \"None of those persistent problems was caused by the Tea Party movement, yet the principles of the Tea Party are exactly what's needed to wind down the multigenerational destruction in the African-American community. \"The NAACP was once a vital weapon in the war against segregation and oppression. All that's left is a bigoted and malicious shell that does far more harm than good for people who need a break,\" he wrote. Fellow St. Louis Tea Party organizer Dana Loesch accused the NAACP of morphing into a political organization. \u201cThey no longer prioritize civil rights,\u201d she told Fox News.",

        "body": " Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used a personal email account to exclusively conduct official business during her time at the State Department, a move that raises questions about access to the full archive of her correspondence, as well as the possibility that she violated federal law requiring official messages to be retained for the record. The existence of the account was discovered by the House select committee investigating the deadly 2012 attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and was first reported by The New York Times. Clinton did not even have a government email address during her tenure as America's top diplomat, which lasted from 2009 to 2013, and The Times reports that her aides took no action to preserve her emails on department servers, as required by the Federal Records Act. Instead, the paper reports, Clinton's advisers selected which of her emails to turn over to the State Department for archival purposes after going through tens of thousands of pages of correspondence. The department said late Monday that it had received 55,000 pages of Clinton's emails as part of a request made to previous secretaries of state to turn over any official documents they may have had in their possession. It is not clear how many total emails from that period were in Clinton's personal account, nor is it clear how Clinton's advisers decided which emails to hand over to the State Department. Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, said the former secretary of state expected that emails to State Department officials -- which she sent to department accounts -- would be preserved. \"When the Department asked former Secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes,\" he said. \"Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government email, as long as appropriate records were preserved.\" The fate of emails to foreign leaders, private citizens, and non-State Department officials is unclear. \"The State Department has long had access to a wide array of Secretary Clinton's records -- including emails between her and Department officials with state.gov accounts,\" State Department Deputy Spokesperson Marie Harf told Fox News late Monday. Harf added that the department turned over about 300 emails to the Benghazi select committee, and noted that Clinton's successor as secretary of state, John Kerry, \"is the first ... to rely primarily on a state.gov email account.\" According to the Times, however, while past secretaries of state often used personal email, updated regulations required such emails to be preserved. Clinton and her aides reportedly did not follow that requirement at the time -- until her office turned over documents. Republicans seized on the developments on Tuesday. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., former chairman of the House oversight committee, said in a statement that Clinton \"failed\" to follow records law. \"The use of a personal e-mail address to skirt public records laws, aside from failing to meet the security standards one would expect of the nation's top diplomat, enabled Clinton to shield her official communications from scrutiny by the media and the American public,\" he said. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was peppered with questions at Tuesday's briefing. He said the administration policy is that employees \"should use their official email accounts when they're conducting official government business.\" He said personal emails also should be preserved and said Clinton's team responded to the request by the department seeking them. Earnest would not say whether the White House believes Clinton broke the law. Records officials interviewed by The Times expressed grave concern over Clinton's practice, saying it represents a severe ethical breach and noting that personal email accounts are far less secure than official ones. Jason Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives, told the paper he found it \"very difficult to conceive of a scenario \u2014 short of nuclear winter \u2014 where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business.\" Baron added that the use of private e-mail accounts is meant to be reserved only for emergencies, such as when a department's server is not working or compromised. However, The Times reports that the imposition of penalties for not complying with federal record-keeping requirements are rare because the National Archives has so few enforcement mechanisms. The report has drawn heavy criticism from Republicans, including at least one potential challenger in the 2016 presidential race. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who released 250,000 emails from his gubernatorial tenure this past December, tweeted about the contrast between his disclosures and Clinton's secrecy. Clinton is widely believed to be the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 2016. The Wall Street Journal reported late Sunday that she was expected to formally launch her candidacy next month.",

        "body": " One of the highest-profile Republicans in the House of Representatives \u2013 where national immigration reform will live or die this year \u2013 said he agrees with giving undocumented immigrants a chance to legalize their status. Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, who is the third-ranking Republican in the House, made his comments in an interview with KBFX-TV in Bakersfield, Calif. just as his fellow GOP lawmakers are expected to unveil any day a set of \u201cimmigration principles\u201d that reportedly call for a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. \u201cThe principles aren\u2019t written yet, but in my personal belief, I think it\u2019ll go with legal status that will allow you to work and pay taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you want to become a citizen, you\u2019ll have to go through the path. There won\u2019t be amnesty inside it.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s district is roughly 35 percent Latino. The House Republican immigration principles reportedly will cover how the U.S. border should be protected, how immigration laws should be enforced inside the United States, and how many of the country\u2019s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants can embark on a path to legalize their status, according to various media stories. The path to legalization\u2019s inclusion in the plan \u2013 which House Republican leaders discussed as recently as Wednesday -- is particularly significant given that it is one of the pivotal reasons that plans last year to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law broke down in the House of Representatives after it passed in the Senate in June. Conservative members of the Republicans in the House, where they hold a majority, had been adamant about not signing off on any measure that called for granting a pathway to legalization for people who are living in the country illegally. They maintain that that giving those immigrants any kind of break would amount to amnesty, or rewarding law-breakers. That created a fight among Republicans in Congress, with some \u2013 including conservatives such as Sen. Marco Rubio, a Tea Party lawmaker from Florida \u2013 arguing that deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants was not a realistic option, and that not doing anything to bring them onto the radar amounted to an amnesty. Proponents of a pathway to legal status argued that the opportunity would be given only to those undocumented immigrants who earned it by meeting a strict set of criteria including paying fines, learning English, having a clean police record and paying taxes. Politico, a news site that covers politics, reported that House Speaker John Boehner, who is from Ohio, wants the plan, also referred to as \u201cprinciples,\u201d completed and made public before President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address on Jan. 28. The plan commits itself to the idea \u2013 which is heavily favored by many Republicans \u2013 that immigration reform will be handled in a piecemeal fashion, instead of comprehensively, as the Senate did. Obama told Senate Democrats this week that he believes that Boehner will make sure immigration reform is passed this year, according to The Hill, a a political publication in Washington, D.C. The president reportedly told the Democrats in a meeting that Republicans need to take action on immigration in order to keep the volatile issue from hurting their chances with Latino voters, as it appears to have done in 2012, when GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney did extremely poorly with the increasingly important voting bloc. Obama obtained three quarters of Latino votes cast in 2012, while Romney racked up 27 percent. Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, was quoted in The Hill as saying: \u201cI think our Republican colleagues realize that to be blocking immigration reform is not good for them.\u201d",

        "body": " The backlash to Indiana's new religious freedom law grew Monday, even as state lawmakers move to clarify the legislation, with Wash. Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana. The statements are the latest boycott threats to emerge over claims that the law has the potential to discriminate against gays and others. Murray, a Democrat who is openly gay, issued his ban via executive order over the weekend, and Inslee issued his Monday afternoon. \u201cI find Indiana\u2019s new law disturbing, particularly at a time when more and more states and people in America are embracing civil rights for everyone,\" Inslee said in a statement. \"Washington will join other states and cities in opposing this law and I will impose an administration-wide ban on state-funded travel to Indiana.\" Murray says the law doesn't reflect Seattle residents\u2019 values. He also has told all city departments to review their contracts to see whether Seattle is doing business with any company whose headquarters is in Indiana. \u201cSeattleites know that discrimination has no place in our city,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s just equality 101.\u201d The primary concern is that the law might allow a business to discriminate against gay residents, such as a baker being allowed refuse an order from a gay couple for a wedding cake. But state lawmakers and Republican Gov. Mike Pence have been defending and trying to explain the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ever since the governor signed it into law on Thursday. They note that then-President Bill Clinton in 1993 signed similar federal legislation into law, and 19 other states also have similar policies. However, the Indiana law differs in several ways, primarily in that it allows a business to assert a right to \"the free exercise of religion.\" On Monday, state Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma, both Republicans, held a press conference to further explain the law. They said they will swiftly try to \"clarify\" its language. \u201cThe new law does not discriminate,\u201d Long said. \u201cAnd it will not be allowed. To the extent that we need to clarify through legislative action, we plan to do just that.\u201d Aside from Indiana, 15 other states have introduced legislation in 2015 to craft or alter their religious freedom laws. Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas have introduced legislation to amend their laws. Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming are looking to put a similar law on their books. Bosma acknowledged a major concern is whether businesses will now be legally permitted to deny services to some people, as a result of the law, and that even he is unclear. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that will be the effect,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are looking at options to clarify that that's the case.\u201d Long and Bosma also conceded they called the press conference because Pence failed to clearly explain the law during an appearance Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Pence said the legislation prohibits Indiana laws that \"substantially burden\" a person's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs, with the definition of \"person\" including religious institutions, businesses and associations. However, he did not answer directly when asked six times whether, under the law, it would be legal for a merchant to refuse to serve gay customers. Long on Monday also denied that a clarification of the law would be needed before this weekend\u2019s men\u2019s NCAA Final Four basketball championships, in Indianapolis. A record-breaking 158,682 people attended the games last year in Texas. And any boycott would have the potential to cut much anticipated revenue for Indianapolis-area hotels, restaurants and other businesses. The NCAA, whose headquarters is in Indianapolis, also has expressed concern about the law, as figures in corporate America and Hollywood voice their opposition. \u201cWe are especially concerned about how this legislation could affect our student-athletes and employees,\u201d said NCAA President Mark Emmert. \u201cWe intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our workforce.\" Angie\u2019s List, the business-rating website, this weekend put on hold plans to expand its Indianapolis headquarters. Actor George Takei is calling for a boycott. And actor Ashton Kutcher recently tweeted: \u201cIndiana are you also going to allow Christian establishments to ban Jews from coming in? Or Vice Versa? Religious freedom??? #OUTRAGE.\u201d",
